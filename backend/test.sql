News quickly surfaced that the mystery buyer was billionaire entertainment magnate David Geffen, who decided to splurge shortly after selling his Beverly Hills mansion to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for $165 million. Geffen had owned the painting previously, but sold it in 1985 to another private buyer. Why are we telling you this in a story about Syria?Amid the chaos and carnage there, news of the secretive Splash purchase was used to fuel a wholly separate tale of intrigue among the ranks of a very different, and very sinister international elite. In this version of events, picked up throughout the region’s press outlets and social media, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad bought the painting as a gift for his British-born wife, Asma, once dubbed “A Rose in the Desert” by Vogue magazine, but now emerging more like the Cersei Lannister of her devastated country.Whatever the truth of the Hockney sale, for many in the Middle East the notion that the Assads would make such a selfish purchase at a time when their country lies in ruins seemed perfectly believable. When Asma was celebrated in Vogue nine years ago (the article has since been deleted), she and her husband were portrayed as a dynamic young couple (he was 46, she was 36) and as potential reformers among the retrograde dictatorships and monarchies of the Arab world. She was attractive, well educated and comfortable in her well-cultivated, upper-middle-class London accent (more so than her local Arabic). It was easy to imagine her capable of curbing her husband’s worst authoritarian tendencies while steering Syria toward greater openness. They had cute kids. She was espousing worthy causes and working with nonprofit NGOs. So, if she was known for spending lavishly on jewelry and clothes, nobody much cared outside the country’s borders, and for Vogue, so much the better. After Five Bloody Years in Syria, Russia Is Turning Against Iran—and AssadBut that was before Assad treated protests as rebellion, responded with savagery, and a civil war began that to date has killed some 500,000 people, even as half the country’s population is displaced internally or has fled to exile as refugees. The conflict spawned huge migration flows in 2015 that massively disrupted European politics, feeding into the hateful xenophobia of the far right. The chaos, and to some extent Bashar al-Assad’s cynical tactics, also helped nurture the rise of the barbarous empire of terror that called itself the Islamic State.Inside Syria there had always been skepticism about the fawning international coverage of Asma, which even before the hard times served to strengthen the perception that despite her charitable enterprises, the first lady lacked any real connection to ordinary citizens. It was clear to anyone who dared look that the regime her husband led was structured to serve a shrinking class of ever more wealthy elites, and Asma was no paradigm, she was a problem.Certainly that’s the way her husband’s mother saw things. THE MOTHER-IN-LAWAnissa Makhlouf, wife of the dynasty’s founder, Hafez al-Assad, grew up in humble rural surroundings in a nation where members of the Alawite sect that she and her husband and his closest allies belonged to were regarded as heretical peasants, even after Hafez, an air-force general, seized power in 1970. Following the death of Hafez in 2000, and the succession of Bashar, Anissa became very much a power in her own right. She did not trust her son’s London-born wife, and she used her influence to marginalize Asma’s public role as well as Asma’s access within the regime.But Mother Anissa died in February 2016 at the age of 86, and since then, Asma, now only 44, has seen her star rise considerably, cultivating an independent power base for herself and her immediate family that challenges other more established members of the extended Assad clans.Once upon a time, many in the West thought that Asma could help restrain Syria’s crony capitalism and brute backdoor dealings, but Bashar’s wife has proved herself highly skilled—indeed, among the most adept and potentially deadly—at navigating the country’s maze of rival cliques for her own benefit. Anissa Makhlouf’s dislike for her daughter-in-law was a reflection of her concern about Bashar al-Assad’s own lack of support among the people as well as within the ruling family and the highest echelons of the regime. Known for being meek and under-appreciated with a distinct inability to look people in the eye, the weak-chinned Bashar prior to 1994 had never been considered for the role of president. His father had groomed his far more charismatic and handsome older brother Bassel as heir apparent. But Bassel died in a car crash in 1994. Even then, Bashar kept a low profile in London, studying optometry in Britain, where he first met Asma, far from palace intrigues. In the BBC documentary A Dangerous Dynasty: House of Assad, a British tutor hired by the family to teach English to the late Bassel remembered his first experience with Bashar as an entirely unremarkable exchange. “I once met Bashar as he was coming into the home, and he didn’t make eye contact with me,” the tutor said. “He just, kind of was looking down at my hand, and stuck out his own hand, and that was it. I remember thinking that the father certainly made a good choice in choosing Bassel as his successor.” After Bassel’s death, Anissa pushed Hafez to select Bashar’s younger brother, Maher, to take Bassel’s place as the next president of Syria. But Hafez knew Maher’s reputation as a hothead prone to violence. Bashar’s other brother, Majid, was purportedly a heroin addict who suffered from a mental disability and could not be trusted to lead. This left Bashar, much to the chagrin of the disapproving mother, to take the reins. Following Hafez’s death in 2000 and Bashar’s appointment as president, Anissa used her influence to strengthen the position of her other relatives to become the true centers of power within Syria, operating around Bashar rather than through him. Maher al-Assad, the favorite, was given control of key military units such as the Republican Guard and 42nd Tank Battalion, which oversaw and controlled profits from key oil wells in the country’s eastern Deir Ezzor province. Anissa’s brother Muhammad Makhlouf and his sons, Hafez, Ayyad, and Rami, already towering figures within the regime, significantly expanded their influence beginning in 2000, following Bashar’s appointment. That year, Rami Makhlouf founded and became CEO of Syriatel, one of only two telecommunications companies in Syria that would go on to dominate 70 percent of the domestic market. Makhlouf and his father, Muhammad, eventually would build a massive business empire and net worth estimated to top $5 billion, while Hafez and Ayyad Makhlouf exerted increased dominance over state security apparatuses. Asma, meanwhile, remained largely on the sidelines. “Before the revolution, regime censors wouldn’t even let us journalists refer to Asma as ‘first lady,’” according to Iyad Aissa, a Syrian opposition journalist who has written extensively about the inner workings of the Assad family, speaking on an Arabic language broadcast. “We were only allowed to describe Asma as ‘the president’s wife,’ unlike Anissa, Bashar’s mother, who was always known as ‘first lady’ during the reign of the father, Hafez.”Over the years, rivalries within rivalries developed. Maher al-Assad saw Muhammad Makhlouf, who chaired Syria’s Euphrates Oil Company, as a threat to his de facto control of petroleum resources in Deir Ezzor. The Makhloufs would also develop increasingly close ties to the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), a secular ultranationalist political party founded in 1932. Hafez al-Assad had built his power through the revolutionary Arab nationalist Baath party, which first seized power in 1963, and the SSNP over the years was seen sometimes as a rival, sometimes an ally. But it had a strong base of popular support, especially in the Alawite heartlands, including the Makhloufs’ hometown of Bustan Basha.The vast majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslims, many of whom eventually, over decades, became sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist groups the Assads then moved to crush. Secular parties like the SSNP and Baath became especially attractive for ambitious religious outsiders, including Christians as well as Alawites. Although the religious-ideological dynamic changed when the Islamic Republic of Iran forged a Shi’a-Alawite alliance with Hafez al-Assad in the 1980s, the party structures remained.Throughout the 2000s, Rami Makhlouf and other members of the family regularly drew on the SSNP to cultivate an independent source of support for themselves outside the scope of the ruling Baath, and before long the SSNP came to be called, only half jokingly, “Rami’s party.” After the popular uprising began in 2011, SSNP cadres would serve as the core of pro-regime militias specifically loyal to the Makhlouf clan. In the first decade of Bashar al-Assad’s presidency, the British-born Asma, whose roots are among Sunni merchant families from Homs and Damascus, was not a significant player. Hacked emails published in 2012 quoted her saying “I am the real dictator.” But not until after Anissa’s death would Asma have the opportunity to involve herself and her relatives more directly in Syria’s politics and economy—and move against rivals in the Makhlouf clan, in particular its leading mogul, Rami Makhlouf.  ASMA’S REVENGEOn May 4, 2020, Rami Makhlouf went missing. Guernica37, an international law and human-rights NGO based in the U.K., issued a press release that day claiming Makhlouf fled to the United Arab Emirates, but it is unclear whether Makhlouf, sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department since 2008, is truly in the UAE or seeking refuge elsewhere. That same day, Syrian Republican Guard units seeking to arrest Makhlouf raided his villa on the outskirts of Damascus, failing to turn up evidence of his whereabouts. Previously, security forces stormed the offices of Syriatel, arresting 28 high-ranking officials, and arrested Wadah Abd al-Rabu, editor in chief of the al-Watan newspaper, one of Syria’s most prominent pro-regime media mouthpieces, which Makhlouf has owned since 2006. As the showdown took shape, Rami Makhlouf issued a series of stunning rebukes to Assad and his regime in two videos uploaded to his personal Facebook page on April 30 and May 3. “Can you believe it?” Makhlouf asked in the second video, “Security services have stormed the offices of Rami Makhlouf, their biggest funder and supporter, most faithful servant, and most prominent patron throughout the whole of the war… The pressure being put on us is intolerable, and inhumane.” The crux of the dispute is control of Syriatel, a joint public-private partnership half owned by the state, which is entitled to roughly 50 percent of the company’s profits in addition to taxes and other state fees. On April 27,  Syria’s Telecommunications and Post Regulatory Authority (TPRA) announced that Syriatel and the country’s only other telecommunication service, MTN, collectively owed $449.65 million to the country’s treasury in annual profits required to be shared with the state. MTN has announced that it intends to pay its $172.9 million share, but Makhlouf has remained defiant. “The state has no right to this money, and it’s turning its back on previous agreements made years back,” Makhlouf declared. “I’ll soon be releasing documents that I’ve already submitted to the relevant authorities clearly demonstrating why they have no right to this money,” he added. In a state known for carrying out the wholesale slaughter of those who test its authority, Makhlouf’s audacity addressing the president like that sent shockwaves throughout the country. But it’s not surprising. This is the culmination of explicit efforts by Asma, Maher, and Bashar al-Assad over the last year to strip Rami Makhlouf and his relatives of their power in Syria. These maneuvering began last August, following Russian demands that the Syrian regime pay back between $2 billion and $3 billion in past due loans, at which point regime security forces put Rami Makhlouf under house arrest in an attempt to force the telecoms mogul to foot the bill.  By September, Asma and a cadre of loyal officials who previously worked in her network of NGOs launched a hostile takeover of the Bustan Cooperative, a charitable organization run by Makhlouf through which the salaries of SSNP and other militiamen loyal to Rami had been paid. In October 2019, it was also announced that Asma would be establishing a third telecommunications company in Syria that aimed to seize market share from Syriatel. Lastly, Syria’s Ministry of Finance issued two separate orders on December 24 and March 17 to freeze assets owned by Rami Makhlouf’s Abar Petroleum Services company that were later used to plug budget deficits within the country’s General Customs Directorate. The targeting of Makhlouf’s assets meanwhile comes as those belonging to a number of Asma’s Sunni relatives have grown significantly.Beginning in 2016, shortly after the death of Anissa al-Makhlouf, members of Asma’s family reportedly took control over significant parts of the market for basic goods in Syria. This followed the introduction of a smart card program to purchase products including rice, gas, bread, tea, sugar and cooking oil. The contract allegedly was given to Takamal, a company run by one of Asma’s brothers and Muhannad al-Dabagh, Asma’s cousin via her maternal aunt. Local media investigations of the company have alleged that a percentage of proceeds reaped from the purchase of goods using smart cards are re-deposited into accounts owned by Takamal’s governing board, run by Asma’s relatives. In December 2019,while many of Rami Makhlouf’s assets were being frozen, those of Asma’s paternal uncle, Tarif al-Akhras, were being thawed.  Syria’s Ministry of Finance had had them locked down for more than a year. Al-Akhras, who owned a small trucking business in Homs prior to 2000, used his niece’s connection to the ruling family to expand his networks. He then began taking part in shipments of food and other goods that ran through Syria into Iraq as part of the Oil for Food Program prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion. Ever since, al-Akhras’ work has expanded into the maritime shipping, construction, real estate and meat packing sectors. Currently, he and other members of Asma’s inner circle stand to see their fortunes continue to improve.  Asma’s move into the economic sphere has coincided with her victory over a year long struggle with breast cancer. The First Lady formally announced her recovery in August, just before security services put Rami Makhlouf under house arrest. Since then, Syria’s Desert Rose has continued if not increased her prolific media appearances documenting her seemingly tireless charitable work across the country. With her newfound economic foothold in place, Asma appears most focused on grooming her children to take their place in the 50 year Assad-Baath party dynasty, often bringing young Hafez, Zain and Karim al-Assad on frontline trips to visit wounded soldiers and inaugurate the opening of new facilities from children’s hospitals to newly built schools for the gifted. As the war winds down, and Asma’s oldest, Hafez, begins his 18th year, talk has already emerged in pro-regime news outlets and on social media discussing his qualifications to succeed Bashar. Taking the lead himself, recently Hafez has begun conducting his own visits to sites across the country, following clearly in his mother’s footsteps.The Russians who saved Bashar’s regime over the last five years, have grown weary of his corruption and wary of his Iranian allies. Maybe Asma imagines they would be open to new faces, albeit with the same name.More than ever, since her recovery from cancer, Asma has been keen to re-cultivate the image of the savior queen that she held and then lost in 2011, one ready and poised to bring up the next generation of Syrians, a woman whose soft touch can heal the country’s wounds. Some world leaders, having long ago succumbed to grim fatigue where Syria is concerned, may be willing to pay lip service at least to this charade. Following a near 10 year lapse, Syria’s Desert Rose could be looking to bloom once more.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

This left Bashar, much to the chagrin of the disapproving mother, to take the reins. Following Hafez’s death in 2000 and Bashar’s appointment as president, Anissa used her influence to strengthen the position of her other relatives to become the true centers of power within Syria, operating around Bashar rather than through him. Maher al-Assad, the favorite, was given control of key military units such as the Republican Guard and 42nd Tank Battalion, which oversaw and controlled profits from key oil wells in the country’s eastern Deir Ezzor province. Anissa’s brother Muhammad Makhlouf and his sons, Hafez, Ayyad, and Rami, already towering figures within the regime, significantly expanded their influence beginning in 2000, following Bashar’s appointment. That year, Rami Makhlouf founded and became CEO of Syriatel, one of only two telecommunications companies in Syria that would go on to dominate 70 percent of the domestic market. Makhlouf and his father, Muhammad, eventually would build a massive business empire and net worth estimated to top $5 billion, while Hafez and Ayyad Makhlouf exerted increased dominance over state security apparatuses. Asma, meanwhile, remained largely on the sidelines. “Before the revolution, regime censors wouldn’t even let us journalists refer to Asma as ‘first lady,’” according to Iyad Aissa, a Syrian opposition journalist who has written extensively about the inner workings of the Assad family, speaking on an Arabic language broadcast. “We were only allowed to describe Asma as ‘the president’s wife,’ unlike Anissa, Bashar’s mother, who was always known as ‘first lady’ during the reign of the father, Hafez.”Over the years, rivalries within rivalries developed. Maher al-Assad saw Muhammad Makhlouf, who chaired Syria’s Euphrates Oil Company, as a threat to his de facto control of petroleum resources in Deir Ezzor. The Makhloufs would also develop increasingly close ties to the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), a secular ultranationalist political party founded in 1932. Hafez al-Assad had built his power through the revolutionary Arab nationalist Baath party, which first seized power in 1963, and the SSNP over the years was seen sometimes as a rival, sometimes an ally. But it had a strong base of popular support, especially in the Alawite heartlands, including the Makhloufs’ hometown of Bustan Basha.The vast majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslims, many of whom eventually, over decades, became sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist groups the Assads then moved to crush. Secular parties like the SSNP and Baath became especially attractive for ambitious religious outsiders, including Christians as well as Alawites. Although the religious-ideological dynamic changed when the Islamic Republic of Iran forged a Shi’a-Alawite alliance with Hafez al-Assad in the 1980s, the party structures remained.Throughout the 2000s, Rami Makhlouf and other members of the family regularly drew on the SSNP to cultivate an independent source of support for themselves outside the scope of the ruling Baath, and before long the SSNP came to be called, only half jokingly, “Rami’s party.” After the popular uprising began in 2011, SSNP cadres would serve as the core of pro-regime militias specifically loyal to the Makhlouf clan. In the first decade of Bashar al-Assad’s presidency, the British-born Asma, whose roots are among Sunni merchant families from Homs and Damascus, was not a significant player. Hacked emails published in 2012 quoted her saying “I am the real dictator.” But not until after Anissa’s death would Asma have the opportunity to involve herself and her relatives more directly in Syria’s politics and economy—and move against rivals in the Makhlouf clan, in particular its leading mogul, Rami Makhlouf.  ASMA’S REVENGEOn May 4, 2020, Rami Makhlouf went missing. Guernica37, an international law and human-rights NGO based in the U.K., issued a press release that day claiming Makhlouf fled to the United Arab Emirates, but it is unclear whether Makhlouf, sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department since 2008, is truly in the UAE or seeking refuge elsewhere. That same day, Syrian Republican Guard units seeking to arrest Makhlouf raided his villa on the outskirts of Damascus, failing to turn up evidence of his whereabouts. Previously, security forces stormed the offices of Syriatel, arresting 28 high-ranking officials, and arrested Wadah Abd al-Rabu, editor in chief of the al-Watan newspaper, one of Syria’s most prominent pro-regime media mouthpieces, which Makhlouf has owned since 2006. As the showdown took shape, Rami Makhlouf issued a series of stunning rebukes to Assad and his regime in two videos uploaded to his personal Facebook page on April 30 and May 3. “Can you believe it?” Makhlouf asked in the second video, “Security services have stormed the offices of Rami Makhlouf, their biggest funder and supporter, most faithful servant, and most prominent patron throughout the whole of the war… The pressure being put on us is intolerable, and inhumane.” The crux of the dispute is control of Syriatel, a joint public-private partnership half owned by the state, which is entitled to roughly 50 percent of the company’s profits in addition to taxes and other state fees. On April 27,  Syria’s Telecommunications and Post Regulatory Authority (TPRA) announced that Syriatel and the country’s only other telecommunication service, MTN, collectively owed $449.65 million to the country’s treasury in annual profits required to be shared with the state. MTN has announced that it intends to pay its $172.9 million share, but Makhlouf has remained defiant. “The state has no right to this money, and it’s turning its back on previous agreements made years back,” Makhlouf declared. “I’ll soon be releasing documents that I’ve already submitted to the relevant authorities clearly demonstrating why they have no right to this money,” he added. In a state known for carrying out the wholesale slaughter of those who test its authority, Makhlouf’s audacity addressing the president like that sent shockwaves throughout the country. But it’s not surprising. This is the culmination of explicit efforts by Asma, Maher, and Bashar al-Assad over the last year to strip Rami Makhlouf and his relatives of their power in Syria. These maneuvering began last August, following Russian demands that the Syrian regime pay back between $2 billion and $3 billion in past due loans, at which point regime security forces put Rami Makhlouf under house arrest in an attempt to force the telecoms mogul to foot the bill.  By September, Asma and a cadre of loyal officials who previously worked in her network of NGOs launched a hostile takeover of the Bustan Cooperative, a charitable organization run by Makhlouf through which the salaries of SSNP and other militiamen loyal to Rami had been paid. In October 2019, it was also announced that Asma would be establishing a third telecommunications company in Syria that aimed to seize market share from Syriatel. Lastly, Syria’s Ministry of Finance issued two separate orders on December 24 and March 17 to freeze assets owned by Rami Makhlouf’s Abar Petroleum Services company that were later used to plug budget deficits within the country’s General Customs Directorate. The targeting of Makhlouf’s assets meanwhile comes as those belonging to a number of Asma’s Sunni relatives have grown significantly.Beginning in 2016, shortly after the death of Anissa al-Makhlouf, members of Asma’s family reportedly took control over significant parts of the market for basic goods in Syria. This followed the introduction of a smart card program to purchase products including rice, gas, bread, tea, sugar and cooking oil. The contract allegedly was given to Takamal, a company run by one of Asma’s brothers and Muhannad al-Dabagh, Asma’s cousin via her maternal aunt. Local media investigations of the company have alleged that a percentage of proceeds reaped from the purchase of goods using smart cards are re-deposited into accounts owned by Takamal’s governing board, run by Asma’s relatives. In December 2019,while many of Rami Makhlouf’s assets were being frozen, those of Asma’s paternal uncle, Tarif al-Akhras, were being thawed.  Syria’s Ministry of Finance had had them locked down for more than a year. Al-Akhras, who owned a small trucking business in Homs prior to 2000, used his niece’s connection to the ruling family to expand his networks. He then began taking part in shipments of food and other goods that ran through Syria into Iraq as part of the Oil for Food Program prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion. Ever since, al-Akhras’ work has expanded into the maritime shipping, construction, real estate and meat packing sectors. Currently, he and other members of Asma’s inner circle stand to see their fortunes continue to improve.  Asma’s move into the economic sphere has coincided with her victory over a year long struggle with breast cancer. The First Lady formally announced her recovery in August, just before security services put Rami Makhlouf under house arrest. Since then, Syria’s Desert Rose has continued if not increased her prolific media appearances documenting her seemingly tireless charitable work across the country. With her newfound economic foothold in place, Asma appears most focused on grooming her children to take their place in the 50 year Assad-Baath party dynasty, often bringing young Hafez, Zain and Karim al-Assad on frontline trips to visit wounded soldiers and inaugurate the opening of new facilities from children’s hospitals to newly built schools for the gifted. As the war winds down, and Asma’s oldest, Hafez, begins his 18th year, talk has already emerged in pro-regime news outlets and on social media discussing his qualifications to succeed Bashar. Taking the lead himself, recently Hafez has begun conducting his own visits to sites across the country, following clearly in his mother’s footsteps.The Russians who saved Bashar’s regime over the last five years, have grown weary of his corruption and wary of his Iranian allies. Maybe Asma imagines they would be open to new faces, albeit with the same name.More than ever, since her recovery from cancer, Asma has been keen to re-cultivate the image of the savior queen that she held and then lost in 2011, one ready and poised to bring up the next generation of Syrians, a woman whose soft touch can heal the country’s wounds. Some world leaders, having long ago succumbed to grim fatigue where Syria is concerned, may be willing to pay lip service at least to this charade. Following a near 10 year lapse, Syria’s Desert Rose could be looking to bloom once more.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Geffen had owned the painting previously, but sold it in 1985 to another private buyer. </p><p>Why are we telling you this in a story about Syria?</p><p>Amid the chaos and carnage there, news of the secretive <em>Splash</em> purchase was used to fuel a wholly separate tale of intrigue among the ranks of a very different, and very sinister international elite. In this version of events, picked up throughout the region’s press outlets and social media, Syrian dictator <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bashar al-Assad\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/bashar-al-assad\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bashar al-Assad </a>bought the painting as a gift for his British-born wife, Asma, once dubbed “<a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:A Rose in the Desert\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/01/the-only-remaining-online-copy-of-vogues-asma-al-assad-profile/250753/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A Rose in the Desert</a>” by <em>Vogue</em> magazine, but now emerging more like the Cersei Lannister of her devastated country.</p><p>Whatever the truth of the Hockney sale, for many in the Middle East the notion that the Assads would make such a selfish purchase at a time when their country lies in ruins seemed perfectly believable. </p><p>When Asma was celebrated in <em>Vogue</em> nine years ago (the article has <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:since been deleted\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/04/26/vogue-paid-25k-for-assad-family-shoot\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">since been deleted</a>), she and her husband were portrayed as a dynamic young couple (he was 46, she was 36) and as potential reformers among the retrograde dictatorships and monarchies of the Arab world. She was attractive, well educated and comfortable in her well-cultivated, upper-middle-class London accent (more so than her local Arabic). It was easy to imagine her capable of curbing her husband’s worst authoritarian tendencies while steering Syria toward greater openness. They had cute kids.

The conflict spawned huge migration flows in 2015 that massively disrupted European politics, feeding into the hateful xenophobia of the far right. The chaos, and to some extent Bashar al-Assad’s cynical tactics, also helped nurture the rise of the barbarous empire of terror that called itself the Islamic State.</p><p>Inside Syria there had always been skepticism about the fawning international coverage of Asma, which even before the hard times served to strengthen the perception that despite her charitable enterprises, the first lady lacked any real connection to ordinary citizens. It was clear to anyone who dared look that the regime her husband led was structured to serve a shrinking class of ever more wealthy elites, and Asma was no paradigm, she was a problem.</p><p>Certainly that’s the way her husband’s mother saw things.</p><h3>THE MOTHER-IN-LAW</h3><p>Anissa Makhlouf, wife of the dynasty’s founder, Hafez al-Assad, grew up in humble rural surroundings in a nation where members of the Alawite sect that she and her husband and his closest allies belonged to were regarded as heretical peasants, even after Hafez, an air-force general, seized power in 1970. Following the death of Hafez in 2000, and the succession of Bashar, Anissa became very much a power in her own right. She did not trust her son’s London-born wife, and she used her influence to marginalize Asma’s public role as well as Asma’s access within the regime.</p><p>But Mother Anissa died in February 2016 at the age of 86, and since then, Asma, now only 44, has seen her star rise considerably, cultivating an independent power base for herself and her immediate family that challenges other more established members of the extended Assad clans.</p><p>Once upon a time, many in the West thought that Asma could help restrain Syria’s crony capitalism and brute backdoor dealings, but Bashar’s wife has proved herself highly skilled—indeed, among the most adept and potentially deadly—at navigating the country’s maze of rival cliques for her own benefit. </p><p>Anissa Makhlouf’s dislike for her daughter-in-law was a reflection of her concern about Bashar al-Assad’s own lack of support among the people as well as within the ruling family and the highest echelons of the regime. Known for being meek and under-appreciated with a distinct inability to look people in the eye, the weak-chinned Bashar prior to 1994 had never been considered for the role of president. His father had groomed his far more charismatic and handsome older brother Bassel as heir apparent. But Bassel died in a car crash in 1994.</p><p>Even then, Bashar kept a low profile in London, studying optometry in Britain, where he first met Asma, far from palace intrigues. </p><p>In the BBC documentary <em>A Dangerous Dynasty: House of Assad</em>, a British tutor hired by the family to teach English to the late Bassel remembered his first experience with Bashar as an entirely unremarkable exchange. “I once met Bashar as he was coming into the home, and he didn’t make eye contact with me,” the tutor said. “He just, kind of was looking down at my hand, and stuck out his own hand, and that was it. I remember thinking that the father certainly made a good choice in choosing Bassel as his successor.” </p><p>After Bassel’s death, Anissa pushed Hafez to select Bashar’s younger brother, Maher, to take Bassel’s place as the next president of Syria. But Hafez knew Maher’s reputation as a hothead prone to violence. Bashar’s other brother, Majid, was purportedly a heroin addict who suffered from a mental disability and could not be trusted to lead. This left Bashar, much to the chagrin of the disapproving mother, to take the reins. </p><p>Following Hafez’s death in 2000 and Bashar’s appointment as president, Anissa used her influence to strengthen the position of her other relatives to become the true centers of power within Syria, operating around Bashar rather than through him. </p><p>Maher al-Assad, the favorite, was given control of key military units such as the Republican Guard and 42nd Tank Battalion, which oversaw and controlled profits from key oil wells in the country’s eastern Deir Ezzor province. </p><p>Anissa’s brother Muhammad Makhlouf and his sons, Hafez, Ayyad, and Rami, already towering figures within the regime, significantly expanded their influence beginning in 2000, following Bashar’s appointment. </p><p>That year, Rami Makhlouf founded and became CEO of Syriatel, one of only two telecommunications companies in Syria that would go on to dominate 70 percent of the domestic market.

This is the culmination of explicit efforts by Asma, Maher, and Bashar al-Assad over the last year to strip Rami Makhlouf and his relatives of their power in Syria. </p><p>These maneuvering began last August, following Russian demands that the Syrian regime pay back between $2 billion and $3 billion in past due loans, at which point regime security forces put Rami Makhlouf under house arrest in an attempt to force the telecoms mogul to foot the bill.  </p><p>By <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:September, Asma and a cadre\" href=\"https://www.almodon.com/arabworld/2019/9/6/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B0%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B2%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">September, Asma and a cadre</a> of loyal officials who previously worked in her network of NGOs launched a hostile takeover of the Bustan Cooperative, a charitable organization run by Makhlouf through which the salaries of SSNP and other militiamen loyal to Rami had been paid. </p><p>In October 2019, it was also announced that Asma would be <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:establishing a third telecommunications company\" href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2019/10/9/assads-wife-stages-hostile-takeover-of-countrys-telecoms-sector\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">establishing a third telecommunications company</a> in Syria that aimed to seize market share from Syriatel. Lastly, Syria’s Ministry of Finance issued <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:two separate orders\" href=\"https://snacksyrian.com/%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-4-%D8%A3%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%B2-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two separate orders</a> on December 24 and March 17 to freeze assets owned by Rami Makhlouf’s Abar Petroleum Services company that were later used to plug budget deficits within the country’s General Customs Directorate. </p><p>The targeting of Makhlouf’s assets meanwhile comes as those belonging to a number of Asma’s Sunni relatives have grown significantly.</p><p>Beginning in 2016, shortly after the death of Anissa al-Makhlouf, members of Asma’s family reportedly took control over significant parts of the market for basic goods in Syria. This followed the introduction of a smart card program to purchase products including rice, gas, bread, tea, sugar and cooking oil. </p><p>The contract allegedly was given to Takamal, a company run by one of Asma’s brothers and Muhannad al-Dabagh, Asma’s cousin via her maternal aunt. <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Local media investigations\" href=\"https://www.jesrpress.com/2020/04/13/%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D9%81%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Local media investigations</a> of the company have alleged that a percentage of proceeds reaped from the purchase of goods using smart cards are re-deposited into accounts owned by Takamal’s governing board, run by Asma’s relatives. </p><p>In December 2019,while many of Rami Makhlouf’s assets were being frozen, those of Asma’s paternal uncle, Tarif al-Akhras, were being thawed.  Syria’s Ministry of Finance had had them locked down for more than a year. </p><p>Al-Akhras, who owned a small trucking business in Homs prior to 2000, used his niece’s connection to the ruling family to expand his networks. He then began taking part in shipments of food and other goods that ran through Syria into Iraq as part of the Oil for Food Program prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion. Ever since, al-Akhras’ work has expanded into the maritime shipping, construction, real estate and meat packing sectors. Currently, he and other members of Asma’s inner circle stand to see their fortunes continue to improve.  </p><p>Asma’s move into the economic sphere has coincided with her victory over <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:a year long struggle with breast cancer.\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/asma-al-assad-wife-of-syrian-president-bashar-al-assad-treated-for-breast-cancer\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a year long struggle with breast cancer.</a> The First Lady formally announced her <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:recovery\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y73LMAgOyug\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recovery </a>in August, just before security services put Rami Makhlouf under house arrest. Since then, Syria’s Desert Rose has continued if not increased her prolific media appearances documenting her seemingly tireless charitable work across the country. </p><p>With her newfound economic foothold in place, Asma appears most focused on grooming her children to take their place in the 50 year Assad-Baath party dynasty, often bringing young Hafez, Zain and Karim al-Assad on frontline trips to visit wounded soldiers and inaugurate the opening of new facilities from children’s hospitals to newly built schools for the gifted. </p><p>As the war winds down, and Asma’s oldest, Hafez, begins his 18th year, talk has already emerged in pro-regime news outlets and on social media discussing his qualifications to succeed Bashar. Taking the lead himself, recently Hafez has begun conducting his own visits to sites across the country, following clearly in his mother’s footsteps.</p><p>The Russians who saved Bashar’s regime over the last five years, have <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:grown weary of his corruption and wary of his Iranian allies\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-is-turning-against-iranand-assadin-syria?ref=wrap\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grown weary of his corruption and wary of his Iranian allies</a>. Maybe Asma imagines they would be open to new faces, albeit with the same name.</p><p>More than ever, since her recovery from cancer, Asma has been keen to re-cultivate the image of the savior queen that she held and then lost in 2011, one ready and poised to bring up the next generation of Syrians, a woman whose soft touch can heal the country’s wounds. </p><p>Some world leaders, having long ago succumbed to grim fatigue where Syria is concerned, may be willing to pay lip service at least to this charade. Following a near 10 year lapse, Syria’s Desert Rose could be looking to bloom once more.</p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read more at The Daily Beast.\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/syrias-desert-rose-asma-al-assad-has-become-its-cersei-lannister?source=articles&amp;via=rss\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

If his coronavirus is negative he could return on the first flight”.Zarif’s statement was reported on the margins of an Iranian parliament foreign and security committee meeting in Tehran.Speaking generally about the return of Iranian prisoners held in the US, Zarif said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to exchange all Iranian prisoners in the United States and other countries, imprisoned under American pressure, with American prisoners in Iran.”He repeated Iran’s position that further talks with the US were not necessary for a prisoner swap between Iran and the US.But the US deputy secretary for homeland security, Ken Cuccinelli , accused Zarif of stalling over Asgari, tweeting: “We have been trying to return Sirous Asgari and you suddenly wake up and say you actually want him back. You say you want all your citizens back, I call BS. How about you put your money where your mouth is? We have 11 of your citizens which are illegal aliens who have been trying to return to your country.”He proposed Zarif charter a plane and then the US would send all 11 Iranians back.He added: “If you have really been speaking the truth these last few weeks and you really want your citizens back then stop stalling and send the plane. The world is watching and expecting the usual outcome namely you will do nothing except keep talking.”Asgari arrived in the US in 2017 with his wife and with valid passports and visas, but upon arrival he discovered he was being prosecuted by the US government for alleged violations of sanctions law.After his acquittal, he was kept in jail on the basis that his visa had expired. He had offered to buy his own flight ticket home, and it looked as if he was being held until the Iranians agreed to release Americans in Iranian custody.The US has been trying to secure the full release of a US Navy veteran, Michael White, who contracted coronavirus in jail and was then transferred to the Swiss embassy in Tehran.

If his coronavirus is negative he could return on the first flight”.Zarif’s statement was reported on the margins of an Iranian parliament foreign and security committee meeting in Tehran.Speaking generally about the return of Iranian prisoners held in the US, Zarif said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to exchange all Iranian prisoners in the United States and other countries, imprisoned under American pressure, with American prisoners in Iran.”He repeated Iran’s position that further talks with the US were not necessary for a prisoner swap between Iran and the US.But the US deputy secretary for homeland security, Ken Cuccinelli , accused Zarif of stalling over Asgari, tweeting: “We have been trying to return Sirous Asgari and you suddenly wake up and say you actually want him back. You say you want all your citizens back, I call BS. How about you put your money where your mouth is? We have 11 of your citizens which are illegal aliens who have been trying to return to your country.”He proposed Zarif charter a plane and then the US would send all 11 Iranians back.He added: “If you have really been speaking the truth these last few weeks and you really want your citizens back then stop stalling and send the plane. The world is watching and expecting the usual outcome namely you will do nothing except keep talking.”Asgari arrived in the US in 2017 with his wife and with valid passports and visas, but upon arrival he discovered he was being prosecuted by the US government for alleged violations of sanctions law.After his acquittal, he was kept in jail on the basis that his visa had expired. He had offered to buy his own flight ticket home, and it looked as if he was being held until the Iranians agreed to release Americans in Iranian custody.The US has been trying to secure the full release of a US Navy veteran, Michael White, who contracted coronavirus in jail and was then transferred to the Swiss embassy in Tehran.

The sample size was selective: all 3,500 people were elderly and had heart failure.</p><p>None of them were infected with the coronavirus. But the researchers involved believe that other research on how ACE2 interacts with the virus can help explain the disparity in death rates between men and women.</p><p>ACE2, found in several organs including the lungs, binds with coronaviruses like the one which causes COVID-19, and allows them to more easily infect healthy cells, according to one of the study authors.</p><p>Dr Adriaan Voors is a professor of cardiology at the University Medical Center Groningen, in the Netherlands, where the study was led.</p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:He told the European Society of Cardiology\" href=\"https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/Men-s-blood-contains-greater-concentrations-of-enzyme-that-helps-COVID-19-infect-cells\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">He told the European Society of Cardiology</a>: \"High levels of ACE2 are present in the lungs and, therefore, it is thought to play a crucial role in the progression of lung disorders related to COVID-19.\"</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>Another author, Dr Iziah Sama of UMC Groningen, said: \"When we found that one of the strongest biomarkers, ACE2, was much higher in men than in women, I realised that this had the potential to explain why men were more likely to die from COVID-19 than women.\"</p><p>Studies from six different countries have found that men are 50% more likely than women to die from COVID-19, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:as Business Insider has previously reported\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-more-men-die-from-coronavirus-than-women-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as Business Insider has previously reported</a>.

Several others tested positive for the virus and didn’t have symptoms either.</p><p>Though a causal connection between the virus and the new illness has yet to be proven, “The relationship seems pretty strong,’’ Schleien said.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>“First of all, we never see these many kids with Kawasaki. Usually we’ll see a few kids a year. We won’t see three dozen over a period of a few weeks.

Schleien said he has seen it in minors as old as 14.</p><p>One fortuitous similarity, though, is that both can be treated effectively, usually with intravenous immunoglobulin and sometimes steroids, followed by aspirin. Hospital stays for patients may last two to four days. Parents are advised to check with a physician or take their children to an emergency room if their fever persists for more than  two to three days, especially if some of the other symptoms appear, including a rapid heartbeat.</p><p>“The good news is that, like Kawasaki disease, almost all the kids are treatable,’’ Schleien said. “It is highly likely that, with treatment, they’re going to be fine. It’s not like the fear of COVID-19 where we know there are no treatments and it’s a matter of luck.’’</p><p>But the apparent link between the two raises concerns, and it’s reasonable to expect more cases to be identified at other COVID-19 hot spots now that there’s more awareness of the inflammatory syndrome.</p><p><span class=\"exclude-from-newsgate\"><strong>Related: </strong><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:More kids fall ill to mysterious Kawasaki-like disease as officials test for coronavirus\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/05/05/what-kawasaki-disease-linked-coronavirus/3083545001/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More kids fall ill to mysterious Kawasaki-like disease as officials test for coronavirus</a></span></p><p><span class=\"exclude-from-newsgate\"><strong>More: </strong><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:3 children have died in New York from a coronavirus-linked inflammatory disease, Cuomo says\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/05/09/coronavirus-new-york-children-die-disease-similar-kawasaki/3103395001/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">3 children have died in New York from a coronavirus-linked inflammatory disease, Cuomo says</a></span></p><p>Schleien said the illness has become such a hot topic among New York-area pediatricians that when his hospital hosted a video call to discuss it, more than 600 logged on and the website crashed.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it’s studying the rare disease and does not have statistics about its incidence.</p><p>“As more data are emerging, CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and other domestic and international partners to better understand and characterize this new syndrome, its prevalence and risk factors for it; and to develop a case definition that will allow us to keep track of it,’’ the agency said through a spokesman.</p><p>On Wednesday, the CDC confirmed it plans to send out an alert in the next couple of days telling doctors to be on the lookout for the syndrome.</p><p>The children’s hospital next to the Stanford University campus, about 35 miles south of San Francisco, may have discovered the first case of the new disease in a 6-month-old baby who was initially diagnosed with Kawasaki, then tested positive for the coronavirus March 16.</p><p>Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the university, hosted a webinar that addressed the case on Friday as scientists try to find out whether the virus precipitates the syndrome.</p><p>“The question is, will this be something to look out for in children over time?’’ she said. “It may be that it’s another inflammatory reaction, like we’re seeing in adults who have inflammation of their lungs.

In a separate case, a federal appeals court threw out a state murder conviction because the crime occurred on land assigned to the tribe before Oklahoma became a state and Congress never clearly eliminated the Creek Nation reservation it created in 1866.</p><p>Gorsuch didn\'t participate in the earlier case because he took part in it when he served on the appeals court in Denver before becoming a justice in 2017. The other eight justices were apparently evenly divided, and they took up a different case so the full complement of nine justices could rule.</p><p>Monday\'s case involved 71-year-old Jimcy McGirt, who is serving a 500-year prison sentence for molesting a child. Oklahoma state courts rejected his argument that his case does not belong in Oklahoma courts and that federal prosecutors should instead handle his case.</p><p>Several justices voiced concerns that a ruling for the tribe could have big consequences for criminal cases, but also tax and other regulatory issues.</p><p>But Gorsuch suggested that those consequences might be overstated, based on what has occurred since the appeals court ruling in the murder case. “I would have thought that ... we might have seen a tsunami of cases, if there were a real problem here, that we haven’t seen,\" the justice said.</p><p>Mithun Mansinghani, the Oklahoma solicitor general, said 178 inmates have sought to reopen their cases, calling those “just the initial cracks in the dam.\"</p><p>But Ian Gershengorn, representing McGirt, said inmates who face equally stiff penalties in federal court and those who already have served a significant portion of their prison terms might do nothing.</p><p>If he wins at the Supreme Court, McGirt could potentially be retried in federal court.</p></div>',1,'rss'),(600,'Laos to press ahead with &#39;destructive&#39; new dam on Mekong','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/laos-press-ahead-destructive-dam-mekong-085936677.html\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qdi96Mjp_QQ.6hzJCNhgAw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/c674ca3930129bf2a16a8fd605865e9a9d8af9f1.jpg\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Laos to press ahead with &#39;destructive&#39; new dam on Mekong\" align=\"left\" title=\"Laos to press ahead with &#39;destructive&#39; new dam on Mekong\" border=\"0\" ></a>Environmentalists have criticised Laos for pressing ahead with plans for another \"destructive dam\" on the Mekong River, a waterway already strangled by hydropower schemes.

Nirav Modi, 49, fled the country while suspected of perpetrating a £1.5 billion bank fraud, the largest in Indian history, on the state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB). The billionaire diamond dealer was arrested in March last year after the Telegraph traced him to an address occupying half a floor in Centre Point tower, where rent is estimated to cost £17,000-a-month, and to an office around the corner in Soho Square. An extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court heard Modi was able to swindle £1.5 billion from the bank by using insiders and threatening to kill witnesses in an international &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot;. Modi also allegedly glued low-grade diamonds onto jewellery so they could be repackaged and sold at a higher price to con lenders, the court heard. Modi has previously protested his innocence through lawyers in court hearings in India. Currently residing at HMP Wandsworth, the 49-year-old appeared via video-link wearing a white shirt and black suit at the first of five scheduled hearings which will decide whether he is to be extradited to India. Helen Malcolm QC, for the Indian government, said the fraud had been orchestrated by fiddling MOUs (memorandums of understanding) - a loan used by businesses to import foreign goods at a cheaper rate. Modi allegedly persuaded corrupt workers within the PNB to sign off MOUs under the pretence that they were being used to pay off exporters on a consignment of pearls from Hong Kong, the court heard. But the &quot;eye-watering&quot; sums of money were instead distributed across other businesses in the Modi empire to pay off a backlog of earlier debt in a &quot;Ponzi scheme of borrowing,&quot; it was said. The magnate then used several &quot;dummy&quot; directors as figureheads to distance himself on paperwork from the companies involved while maintaining control. Ms Malcolm said the PNB caught wind of the scheme in 2018. The court heard Modi and his brother &quot;set out on a campaign to frighten witnesses&quot; when the fraud was discovered. One witness was said to be &quot;threatened with death and implication in a theft&quot;, while mobile phones belonging to a number of people were allegedly destroyed in order to get rid of evidence.

combining with established diseases to pose a lethal threat in a region where medical care is poor.</p><p>In the past month, the city of Kano, the most populous city in the north of the country, has witnessed hundreds of deaths, particularly among the elderly.</p><p>At first authorities blamed the fatalities on ailments including diabetes, hypertension and malaria -- but a team of government investigators later said most were suspected to be linked to coronavirus.</p><p>Kano state has officially confirmed 666 infections and 32 deaths from coronavirus, making it the hardest-hit region in Nigeria after megacity Lagos.</p><p>Testing has been severely limited but as capacity has picked up in recent days so the number of cases has climbed steadily.</p><p>Now the surge in unexplained deaths has spread to neighbouring areas, sending local authorities scrambling to figure out the cause.</p><p>A team of epidemiologists has been sent to the town of Azare in Bauchi state, where 110 deaths were reported in the past week, local traditional chief Mahmood Abdullahi said.</p><p>Medics are also probing a string of similar spikes in towns in Yobe and Jigawa states neighbouring Kano.</p><p>- \'Watched my husband die\' -</p><p>Doctors say the hottest time of year from April to June has always brought more death to northern Nigeria.</p><p>Deadly outbreaks of cholera, malaria, typhoid, measles and meningitis tend to shoot up as the temperature rises.</p><p>The arrival of the novel coronavirus has added another major challenge -- and stretched already under-resourced health services beyond breaking point.</p><p>\"We can\'t deny the fact that COVID-19 is wreaking havoc in Kano and the region which is worsened by other outbreaks that have preceded the pandemic,\" Kano doctor Ibrahim Musa said.</p><p>So common is the surge in diseases at this time of year that people in the city even have a grim nickname for it -- \"merger\".</p><div class=\"caas-readmore

continues</button></div><p>\"We are dealing with multiple epidemics in this situation which explains the mind-boggling deaths,\" said Sadiq Wali, a professor of medicine.</p><p>Making the problem worse, hospitals have shut their doors to the sick out of fears over coronavirus -- meaning treatment for a raft of ailments has stopped.</p><p>Doctors short of protective equipment have also been reluctant to attend to patients even without signs of the virus out of concerns for their own safety.</p><p>Civil servant Binta Mohammed said that she had to watch her husband die from \"diabetic complications\" after he was turned away for treatment.</p><p>\"The four private hospitals we took him to refused to admit him for fear he had the virus,\" she said.</p><p>Kano\'s governor on Sunday called on private hospitals to attend patients with other ailments and doled out face masks and sanitiser.</p><p>\"We don\'t want you to be sending away patients who come to you for other illnesses,\" Abdullahi Umar Ganduje said.</p><p>- \'COVID-19 earthquake\' -</p><p>Kano\'s position as a central economic hub for the region means that it is an epicentre for many outbreaks that have spread across the north.</p><p>Officials in neighbouring states say a plan that has seen hundred of child beggars sent home from the city has helped infections spread.</p><p>\"When Kano has a cold the whole north gets the flu,\" medical doctor Musa explained.</p><p>While the state has been under official lockdown for four weeks, enforcement has been lax beyond major highways and thoroughfares.</p><p>Life goes on as normal in many neighbourhoods as the faithful still flock to mosques for Ramadan prayers despite edicts from Muslim leaders.</p><p>State authorities on Monday began handing out a million facemasks and warned of a crackdown on those not distancing -- but some worry it may be too late.</p><p>\"People are foolishly daring a COVID-19 earthquake,\" Musa

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2020The election is expected to take place largely by mail, common in California, and the state mailed a ballot to all registered voters in the district. Still, there will be some opportunity for in-person voting. But though Democrats complained that the lack of a polling location in Lancaster would harm minority voters, officials added the additional location after R Rex Parris, the city’s Republican mayor, requested it.Though he thinks it’s dangerous to vote in person during the Covid-19 pandemic, Parris told the Guardian he made the request after realizing a nearby city had two polling locations, while his city had none. While he believes elections can be rigged and understood why it might have appeared that way to Trump, he said adding the polling location was not a Democratic power grab.“I gotta take the rap. I called them up and said I want a vote center, so they gave it to me,” he said.The California accusations underscore how the president could take advantage of the way voting procedures are rapidly changing in response to Covid-19 and question the legitimacy of election results in November.While Trump has long railed, without evidence, that elections are tainted by voter fraud, the increased focus on vote-by-mail amid the pandemic could offer a new thread for him to pull on to undermine confidence in elections this year. Several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem.“Given that the president has been making unsubstantiated voter fraud comments for years, I expect that these comments will continue,” said Richard Hasen, a professor of election law at the University of California, Irvine. “The comments are very worrisome because they increase the chances that the president’s supporters would not accept the election results as legitimate should he lose in November.”Hasen and other experts helped author a report last month offering guidance on how to shore up confidence in the results of the 2020 election. The recommendations include getting states to develop emergency contingency plans well in advance and educating the public that election results might not be available on election night as officials count mailed-in ballots.Democrats and Republicans are already fighting over how aggressively to expand efforts to vote by mail in November, but the fight over the availability of in-person voting is likely to continue to be an explosive issue. Faced with poll worker shortages and concerns about in-person gathering, election officials have severely cut back in-person voting. Parties and campaigns are likely to aggressively fight over which polling places close and where the new ones are placed.“All of those changes allow for someone frankly who wants to undermine our faith in the election system to say ‘look at what they’re doing to you. This is a corrupt system,’” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.“Certainly whenever there’s a change in how we vote I think it can be unsettling for people, and they can question whether or not they can have faith in the system, and President Trump has seized that opening.”<p><br clear=\"all\">','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/rigged-trump-foreshadows-could-undermine-120010040.html\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W0ZOEcdxvuiwQEp38i.lwQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/c55edb0459fb28c4378457be6d45e576\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"&#39;It&#39;s all rigged&#39;: Trump foreshadows how he could undermine presidential election\" align=\"left\" title=\"&#39;It&#39;s all rigged&#39;: Trump foreshadows how he could undermine presidential election\" border=\"0\" ></a>Trump accusations shed light on how he could use the Covid-19 pandemic to undermine the results of the November electionDonald Trump falsely accused Democrats of trying to “steal” Tuesday’s special election in California amid the Covid-19 pandemic by adding a polling place in one of the most diverse sections of a district.But the county actually added the polling location at the request of the area’s Republican mayor.In a move that could foreshadow his approach to November’s presidential election, Trump said Democrats were deliberately adding one of the few polling locations over the weekend in Lancaster, a city North of Los Angeles, where it was likely to benefit Democratic voters. “They are trying to steal another election.

Several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem.</p><p>“Given that the president has been making unsubstantiated voter fraud comments for years, I expect that these comments will continue,” said Richard Hasen, a professor of election law at the University of California, Irvine. “The comments are very worrisome because they increase the chances that the president’s supporters would not accept the election results as legitimate should he lose in November.”</p><p>Hasen and other experts helped author <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:a report\" href=\"https://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/full-time/hasen/2020ElectionReport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a report </a>last month offering guidance on how to shore up confidence in the results of the 2020 election.

Faced with poll worker shortages and concerns about in-person gathering, election officials have severely cut back in-person voting. Parties and campaigns are likely to aggressively fight over which polling places close and where the new ones are placed.</p><p>“All of those changes allow for someone frankly who wants to undermine our faith in the election system to say ‘look at what they’re doing to you. This is a corrupt system,’” said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</p><p>“Certainly whenever there’s a change in how we vote I think it can be unsettling for people, and they can question whether or not they can have faith in the system, and President Trump has seized that opening.”</p></div>',1,'rss'),(614,'U.S. House Democrats float $3 trillion coronavirus bill, Republicans reject it','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/u-house-democrats-float-3-032716008.html\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/27VhW6H.TUCQ6ViITP0_5A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/1832ee1bc524ca9519df6e2b338546b7\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"U.S. House Democrats float $3 trillion coronavirus bill, Republicans reject it\" align=\"left\" title=\"U.S. House Democrats float $3 trillion coronavirus bill, Republicans reject it\" border=\"0\" ></a>Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday unveiled a $3 trillion-plus coronavirus relief package with funding for states, businesses, food support and families, only to see the measure flatly rejected by Senate Republicans.

Biron</p><p>WASHINGTON, May 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As U.S. states start to ease coronavirus lockdowns, one group warns that its troubles are worsening without enough financial support: renters.</p><p>\"All of these companies are getting bailouts — we need a bailout, too!\" said Sami Bourma, a chef and Uber driver in the Washington area who has been unable to work since late March.</p><p>Instead, the 47-year-old father-of-two has not paid his monthly rent of about $1800 on his one-bedroom flat in the past two months, along with what he said are hundreds of others in his apartment complex in Alexandria, Virginia.</p><p>The tenants are urging both policymakers and the property owner to make rent contingent on income through the pandemic and in the months of recovery that are to follow.</p><p>The property owner, Bell Partners, did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>\"I don\'t have much money in my account. And no one knows how long the pandemic will take, so what options do I have?\" Bourma told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p><p>About 43 million households in the United States are renters, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council, an industry group.</p><p>Like Bourma, almost half of renters by mid-April were already experiencing difficulty paying for housing, food or medical care, according to the Urban Institute think tank.</p><p>That is more than twice the figures for homeowners.</p><p>Covering the housing for vulnerable tenants would cost about $100 billion, according to some estimates, and housing advocates are now rallying around a federal proposal to make that amount available in upcoming emergency funding.</p><p>In the meantime, nearly 200,000 people across the country have, like Bourma, refused to pay their rent, according to a tracker called We Strike Together — bolstered by some campaigns across entire cities or states.</p><p>\"If May 1 is hard (when rent payments are typically due), June 1 will be harder without any action,\" said said Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, a nonprofit that helped set up the tracker.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>Rent strikes amid the pandemic have not been confined to the United States, with related organizing taking place in recent weeks in Australia, Canada, Britain, France and beyond.</p><p>\'UNPRECEDENTED\'</p><p>The current housing crisis for U.S. renters is unprecedented in recent decades, housing experts say, as is the level of cohesion it has inspired across the country.</p><p>\"For people who have been in housing for the past 50 years, the impact that most of us can remember is the foreclosure crisis (after the 2008-09 crisis), but the magnitude of this is greater,\" said Dianne Enriquez of the nonprofit Center for Popular Democracy.</p><p>But nonpayment of rent can have a serious ripple effect, industry groups have warned — including negatively affecting tenant credit histories, potentially making it harder for people to rent in the future.</p><p>\"Rent strikes are counterproductive and ultimately harmful to all residents,\" said Bob Pinnegar, head of the National Apartment Association, an industry group.</p><p>\"Bankrupting property owners is going to create many more problems than it would solve,\" he said in emailed comments, noting that federal assistance is \"urgently\" needed for both renters and owners.</p><p>On average only 9% of rent goes to building owners or investors, he added, with most covering mortgages, taxes, maintenance and more.</p><p>\"By causing financial hardship for the owners, people participating in a rent strike will further exacerbate the housing affordability crisis the country was grappling with prior to this pandemic,\" he said.</p><p>A spokesman for the U.S. department of housing and urban development said it would work with Congress on \"ways to provide economic relief for Americans who are struggling to make ends meet during these unprecedented times\".</p><p>As yet, mass rent strikes have remained more of a threat than a reality: About a fifth of renters did not pay by May 6, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council, roughly the same as the previous month.</p><p>But the fact remains, said Enriquez, that \"even if they\'re not calling it a rent strike, most tenants in this country are simply unable to pay rent.\"</p><p>On Friday, the United States announced that more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April, resulting in an unemployment rate of 14.7% — the highest since the Great Depression of 1929-32.</p><p>There are parallels with the response by renters, too, researchers say.</p><p>Nine decades ago, as millions lost their homes amid spiking unemployment, the U.S. Communist Party undertook a national effort that included mass rent strikes — ending only when direct federal assistance allowed people to pay their rents, he said.</p><p>\"Today, tens of millions of people cannot pay rent or mortgages,\" said Fordham University historian Mark Naison, who has studied rent strikes.</p><p>\"Activists all over the country are urging rent strikes and contemplating eviction resistance until the crisis facing the incomeless is resolved,\" he added.</p><p>RENT CANCELLATION</p><p>Local and federal authorities scrambling to protect renters have temporarily halted evictions in several states including New York and California.</p><p>But such actions only push a major problem down the road, critics warn — potentially leading to mass evictions.</p><p>\"There are lots of municipal leaders who recognize that when these eviction moratoriums are lifted, we\'ll have massive homeless problems,\" said Jeremiah Ellison, a member of the Minneapolis City Council.</p><p>That concern has led Ellison and others to push for the outright cancellation of rent amid the pandemic, with landlords to be reimbursed by the government.</p><p>\"We\'ve used emergency powers at the state level to prevent evictions, and so I\'ve asked the (Minnesota) attorney general to look into using emergency powers to work out a similar deal when it comes to rent,\" he said by phone.</p><p>A letter he sent last month to Minnesota state leaders received a flood of support that Ellison said surprised him, including majority backing from the city councils of Minneapolis and neighbouring St. Paul, as well as municipal leaders from around the state.</p><p>\"There\'s been lots of discussion of the costs of rent cancellation, but if we have hundreds of thousands of people becoming homeless at the end of this crisis, I don\'t know how we\'ll pay for a solution to that, either,\" said Ellison.</p><p>A federal legislative proposal would cancel rent and suspend mortgage payments through the pandemic, starting in April.</p><p>Some say rent cancellation needs to extend beyond the pandemic.</p><p>\"There is also going to be a time of recovery. A lot of businesses won\'t be able to reopen immediately, or they might start out a bit slower,\" said Tiana Caldwell, a business trainer and housing activist in Kansas City, Missouri.</p><p>But until such a policy is in place, Caldwell feels she has no choice: She is not paying her rent.</p><p>The 42-year-old has not been able to do her job since mid-March. Nor has her husband, who stopped going to work to ensure he does not bring the virus home and infect Caldwell, who has battled recurring cancer.</p><p>The couple\'s situation underscores how widespread the current vulnerability is, she said: \"It\'s more than just the poor ... There are many, many people who are just one emergency away from being homeless.\" (Reporting by Carey L. Biron, Editing by Zoe Tabary.

To meet in the Capitol to debate and vote is dangerous. There is a combustible combination of difficulty and risk in traveling long distances, especially by air; the particular vulnerability of older members, who make up a large share of the House and Senate, and the reality of members and staff in close quarters. The danger is not just to them, but to their families and all who come into contact with them.</p><p>The alternative as of now is to pull together the constitutionally required quorum of half the members.

But the state allows local governments to keep imposing stricter guidelines, and health officials in high-density areas like Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area have not yet supported easing restrictions.</p><p>Similarly, counties with few or stabilized cases can apply to the state for permission to open more businesses, including restaurants serving sit-down meals, and allow customers inside shopping malls, retail stores and swap meets. Schools can open with modifications.</p><p>Six Northern California counties, Butte, El Dorado, Lassen, Nevada, Placer and Shasta, received that permission on Tuesday.</p><p>To reopen, restaurants must retool their dining rooms to accommodate social distancing, closing areas where customers congregate or touch food, and stop setting tables with shared condiments such as mustard containers.

The second-most prominent story told us that “Grocery Prices Are Soaring” (which is true if you think that a 2.6 percent increase in April should be called “soaring”), the third-most-prominent item told us, “Doctors treating coronavirus patients are seeing odd and frightening syndromes.” Running down the rail on the right we were given such important developments as “Man refusing to wear a mask breaks arm of Target employee,” “CNN Investigates: He&#39;s willing to get Covid-19 to speed up vaccine efforts,” “Five surfers die after huge layer of sea foam hampers rescue” and “How coronavirus spread from one member to 87% of the singers at a choir practice.”Only after all of this stuff did we learn that CNN has a new poll out, under the headline, “CNN Poll: Biden tops Trump nationwide, but battlegrounds tilt Trump.” Polls are expensive, news organizations tend to hype them breathlessly to generate headlines in rival media outlets, Wednesday was (obviously) a slow news day, and politics is one of CNN’s core topics. Yet CNN seemed oddly unenthused about its own poll. And the story to which the homepage linked doesn’t mention that Trump had never scored higher in a CNN poll. True, there are lots of noisy data in the piece, most of which cut against Trump. But on the other hand the single most surprising and hence most newsworthy detail of the poll was that Trump holds a seven-point lead over Biden in the battleground states. The CNN story doesn’t even tell us what that figure is -- seven points seems like a pretty big number -- and downplays its own finding by noting, “Given the small sample size in that subset of voters, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the movement is significant or a fluke of random sampling.”The headline of a different CNN news story about the same poll carries the headline, “CNN Poll: Negative ratings for government handling of coronavirus persist” over a picture of Trump looking downcast. This story, unlike the other one, mentions (but not till the fourth paragraph) that Trump’s approval rating of 45 percent “now matches his high point in CNN polling dating back to the start of his term.”I don’t want to spin this poll as great news for President Trump -- he has a 55 percent disapproval rating, and only 36 percent think he’s a trustworthy source of information about the crisis -- but the story of the 21st century has been persistently low faith in  presidents, government, Congress, and the direction of the country. President Obama had an approval rating of about 48 percent at this point in May of 2012, on his way to being reelected by a wide margin. Joe Biden has an approval rating of only 45 percent, as against 46 percent disapproval, and that’s with Biden mostly shielded from public view. Biden’s penchant for gaffes largely escape notice when his public appearances mainly consist of reading from a Teleprompter in his basement, whereas Trump’s gaffes make headlines. Biden bears no responsibility for all the things that have gone wrong, whereas Trump not only gets heaped with blame, but the pressure of managing a crisis spurs him on to more gaffes. Trump probably doesn’t need to win a plurality of voters to win a majority of Electoral College votes. And being disliked by a majority didn’t stop him before: The day he was elected president, he had a 37.5 percent approval rating, according to the RealClearPolitics poll of polls.Biden does appear to be the favorite at the moment; he is, after all, leading in nationwide polls by an average of 4.5 percent, according to RealClearPolitics. He appears to have carved out a substantial lead among older voters, whom Trump has to thank for his win in 2016. Yet betting markets still rate Trump a big favorite. After three and a quarter years of the media talking themselves into believing the “walls are closing in,” “the noose is tightening,” and “the endgame has begun,” the voters don’t seem to be confirming that Trump is toast. On the contrary, they have substantially more positive views about Trump than they did when they elected him president.

And Biden can’t hide in that basement forever.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h4>More from National Review</h4><ul class=\"caas-list caas-list-bullet\"><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pretending Joe Biden Is Fine\" href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pretending-joe-biden-is-fine/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pretending Joe Biden Is Fine</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Jonathan Karl vs. Jim Acosta\" href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/jonathan-karl-vs-jim-acosta/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Karl vs. Jim Acosta</a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Another Blow to the Sexual Compartmentalizers\" href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/another-blow-to-the-sexual-compartmentalizers/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Another Blow to the Sexual Compartmentalizers</a></p></li></ul></div>',0,'rss'),(623,'20,000 migrants have been expelled along border under coronavirus order','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/20-000-migrants-expelled-along-202027698.html\"><img src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e3MZ3zTwcQvp68WQ1UEQ3g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/7070aad7cbbdc10679267cba3b9cb9f7\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"20,000 migrants have been expelled along border under coronavirus order\" align=\"left\" title=\"20,000 migrants have been expelled along border under coronavirus order\" border=\"0\" ></a>More than 90% of the families, children and single adults that Border Patrol encountered in April were expelled under a public health order.<p><br clear=\"all\">','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/20-000-migrants-expelled-along-202027698.html\"><img src=\"http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e3MZ3zTwcQvp68WQ1UEQ3g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/7070aad7cbbdc10679267cba3b9cb9f7\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"20,000 migrants have been expelled along border under coronavirus order\" align=\"left\" title=\"20,000 migrants have been expelled along border under coronavirus order\" border=\"0\" ></a>More than 90% of the families, children and single adults that Border Patrol encountered in April were expelled under a public health order.<p><br clear=\"all\">','https://news.yahoo.com/20-000-migrants-expelled-along-202027698.html','Wed, 13 May 2020 22:55:30 -0400','CBS News','https://www.cbsnews.com/','20-000-migrants-expelled-along-202027698.html','[{\'height\': \'86\', \'url\': \'http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e3MZ3zTwcQvp68WQ1UEQ3g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/7070aad7cbbdc10679267cba3b9cb9f7\', \'width\': \'130\'}]','','us_yahoonews_rss','21:39:53.527896','<div class=\"caas-body\"><p>The Trump administration announced on Thursday that officials at the southern border have expelled more than 20,000 unauthorized migrant adults, families and children from the U.S. under a broad public health order issued in late March in response to the <span class=\"link\"><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:coronavirus\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus</a></span> pandemic.</p><p>Citing the emergency directive by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), border officials sent more than 14,000 migrants to Mexico or their home countries in April, according to new <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:government data\" href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics/title-8-and-title-42-statistics?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">government data</a>.

More than 90% of the adults, families and unaccompanied children encountered by Border Patrol in April were expelled.</p><p>Most of the 15,862 migrants encountered by Border Patrol last month were single adults, but 604 families and 734 unaccompanied minors were also processed. Officials did not immediately say how many of these families and children were processed under the CDC order, but government data suggests most of them were expelled.</p><p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement, charged with caring for unaccompanied migrant minors, received only 58 children from border officials in April, according to <span class=\"link\"><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:the data obtained by CBS News\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-immigration-migrant-children-protections-border/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the data obtained by CBS News</a></span>.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan reiterated on Thursday that the order is not part of the administration\'s immigration agenda, but rather a measure to safeguard public health.</p><p>\"This is not about immigration,\" Morgan told reporters during a remote briefing.</p><p>Advocates, however, disagree, saying the administration is accomplishing something it has sought to do for years: restrict access to humanitarian protections for unauthorized migrants who arrive at the border. Since officials are processing most of them under public health law, migrants could be denied the opportunity to apply for humanitarian programs, like asylum, that are enshrined in U.S. immigration law. </p><p>Thelma Garcia, an immigration attorney in the Rio Grande Valley, the most heavily patrolled sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, said the CDC directive is being used to deny migrants access to America\'s asylum system.</p><p>\"There are still problems in Central America. People are still fleeing. Once they cross the border into the U.S., nobody knows anything about them because they are deported so quickly. And I\'m sure there\'s a lot of people in there with some good claims that should not be removed,\" Garcia told CBS News. \"But they are using the pandemic as an excuse not to follow the immigration and asylum laws.\"</p><p>The CDC order was first issued on March 20 and renewed late last month for another 30 days. Morgan did not confirm whether it will be extended yet again beyond the current May 20 end date, saying health officials will make that determination. But he said the public health risk posed by processing large numbers of migrants persists, citing the growing coronavirus cases in Mexico.</p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:More children diagnosed with illness possibly linked to the coronavirus\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/more-children-diagnosed-with-illness-possibly-linked-to-the-coronavirus?ftag=YHFaf537c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">More children diagnosed with illness possibly linked to the coronavirus</a></p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump says he was &quot;surprised&quot;

A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge,” he said.The former president’s comments come amid dual crises – one a pandemic disproportionately sickening people of color in the US, and another born by the economic impacts of attempts to contain the virus through lockdowns. So far, there have been 1.4 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and 88,000 people have died from the virus.Those crises, as well as the high-profile killings of black people by police, loomed large in the virtual event, itself necessitated by the shutdown of large gatherings to stem the spread of the disease.“These aren’t normal times. You’re being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession,” said Obama.He added that the injustices faced by African Americans are not new, and described the recent high-profile killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black jogger who was shot and killed after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in Georgia.“We see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn’t submit to their questioning,” said Obama.He went on to use the circumstances of the online graduation as a rallying cry for new graduates: “If the world’s going to get better, it’s going to be up to you.”Although Obama has largely avoided criticizing Trump’s performance in office, in a call leaked last week the former president described the US government’s coronavirus response as, “an absolute chaotic disaster,” and questioned whether the justice department’s decision to drop charges against former national security advisor Michael Flynn could endanger the “rule of law” in the United States.The remarks prompted the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to tell the former president to “keep his mouth shut”. The week also saw the emergence of Obamagate, which one former CIA analyst described as, “a hashtag in search of a scandal”.Obama’s remarks were preceded by speeches and performances by musicians, actors and entertainers such as Steve Harvey, Anthony Hamilton, Doug E Fresh, Wyclef Jean, Common, Kevin Hart, Wendy Raquel Robinson and Vivica A Fox.Messages to graduates tuning in online because they could not hold traditional celebrations on campus were shot through with acknowledgements of America’s history of racial segregation.This, speakers said, made the universities essential, while noting the perseverance required to spend a final semester largely online, and the bittersweetness of the moment itself.“This is obviously not the way you wanted to graduate, we get that,” said Doc Rivers, coach of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers, “But you know what else we know? You’re going to make us all proud.”Graduates, speakers said, would be sent out into an “uncertain world,” but one they had a chance to improve upon.“As graduates, you now join the ranks of national and world leaders, influencers,” said Senator Kamala Harris of California.“I know this is a trying time, but please do not let the moment of this crisis dampen your ambitions, your hopes or your dreams, because your country needs you,” said Harris. She attended the HBCU Howard, recently ran for the Democratic nomination and is a contender to become Joe Biden’s running mate in the 2020 election.Obama attended Columbia and Harvard Law.

China said a few \"unscrupulous souls\" had tried to smuggle the boy abroad and so his parents had asked for protection, which it was supplying.</p><p>Despite the security, Beijing said the boy and his family were living normal lives and did not want anyone to bother them, something it has repeated often since then.</p><p>Occasionally, the Chinese government offered a glimpse that not all was well.</p><p>In 1998, it told the working group that the Panchen Lama\'s mother was serving a prison sentence, although it is not clear what for or how long she was incarcerated.</p><p>At times there have been other sources of news.</p><p>In 2000, Robin Cook, then the British foreign secretary, said China had shown UK officials two photographs of a boy it said was the missing Panchen Lama.</p><p>One showed a child playing table tennis; in the other the boy was writing Chinese characters on a blackboard.

Orange wine, made from grapes typically used for white wine, but without removing the skins, has seen a renewed interest amid surging wine sales during the <span class=\"link\"><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:coronavirus pandemic\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coronavirus pandemic</a></span>. </p><p>\"You don\'t see a lot of large wineries making orange wine,\" winemaker Hardy Wallace told CBS News\' Jamie Wax. \"For small producers like us, it\'s a huge opportunity to reach people far and wide.\" </p><p>Wallace is a partner at Dirty and Rowdy Family Winery in California, one of the small operations that has gotten on the fast-growing trend. He compared the jump from white to orange wine to changing up music.</p><p>\"By leaving these skins on, it\'s the same music — I\'m just gonna go and adjust the volume. We\'re gonna take this from four, we\'re going to take this to seven. If you\'re a guitar player, sometimes you wanna hit you wanna hit the distortion pedal,\" he said. </p><p>People who see orange wine\'s bright hue may often assume it will be sweet and light, but Wallace said that is far from its actual taste.</p><p>\"People, they see orange and they automatically think of the fruit,\" Wallace said. \"Orange wine is usually heavier, it\'s more dense, more tannic, more mouth-filling.\"</p><p>The method of fermenting grapes meant for <span class=\"link\"><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:white wine\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/millennials-drive-first-decrease-in-wine-consumption-in-25-years/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">white wine</a></span> with their skins on originated as a peasant tradition in the Republic of Georgia, a small country nestled between Europe and Asia, thousands of years ago. </p><p>Today, not much has changed about the method. At Wallace\'s winery the grapes for orange wine are crushed by foot, like they were centuries ago.</p><p>\"A lot of people would say this is crazy, this is ridiculous. But they\'re making much larger quantities of wines,\" he said. The batch he was working on would make 600 bottles.</p><p>He added that the non-automated process is the \"magic\" of it.</p><p>After the grapes are stomped and drained, a press squeezes out the last bit of juice coming out. </p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>Dirty and Rowdy\'s 2018 skin-fermented semillon was named one of the best orange wine in the world.</p><p>The best pairing? Wallace said it\'s \"an empty glass.\"</p><p>\"I think that\'s the beautiful thing, it\'s so versatile. Like, you have this with scallops, and it kills it, because it gives you that incredible acidity but we also have just enough tannin to work,\" Wallace said. \"You take this and have like, a thing of chips and salsa, and you\'ll have a good night.\" </p><p>Sam Stoppelmoor, wine director at Compagnie Des Vins Surnaturels in <span class=\"link\"><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:New York\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-stay-at-home-extended-coronavirus-lockdown/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New York</a></span>, said orange wine\'s new prominence on the world stage is rare, but not unheard of.</p><p>\"I think you\'re seeing this trend of like, these rustic kind of local styles, being like, \'Oh, there\'s a reason they\'ve done this for thousands of years.

It was also called into action to conduct hostage-rescue operations, the former member said.</p><p>Berry, an engineer sergeant, served from 1996 to 2013. Denman, a communications sergeant, spent five years in the Army until 2011.</p><p>Drew White, a former Green Beret in the same unit, said Goudreau was a highly skilled team leader who earned his fellow soldiers’ respect.</p><p>“He was a force to be reckoned with,” White said. “An incredible soldier who never got rattled. All of us looked up to him.”</p><p>Berry met his now-wife Melanie, who is German, in Stuttgart in 1999. “We were both shy,” she said. “I could tell he was kind, and I felt so at ease around him.”</p><p>They married the next year and went on to have two kids, who are now teenagers. After leaving the service, Berry remodeled homes and focused on his family.</p><p>But this past January, he left Germany after telling his wife he accepted a job with Goudreau’s company. “He trusted Jordan,” Melanie Berry said. “He believed in Jordan.”</p><p>She said her husband wouldn’t give details about his job or how long he expected to be gone. “He said he couldn’t share anything with me but that it’s for a good cause,” Melanie Berry recalled.</p><p>After Denman left the service, he bounced around the country and worked a handful of jobs – first at a tree nursery in Austin, then in hotel security in Florida and finally as an underwater welder in Louisiana.</p><p>Unlike many former Special Forces members, he seemed uninterested in pursuing contract work overseas, according to his family and friends.</p><p>Sometime in 2017, Denman visited his old Special Forces buddy White during a cross-country motorcycle trip. “When he was here, he was still Luke but it just seemed he was searching for something,” White said. “I thought he had found it with the welding stuff, but looking back on it, I think he just missed the camaraderie and having that sense of purpose.”</p><p>In late 2019, Denman was living with his girlfriend, Tatianna Saito, in Oregon. The pair had met in Austin and had been dating for five years. Saito said they had recently begun talking about starting a family together.</p><p>Like Berry, Denman left in January and said little about what he was doing or where he was going.</p><p>“I didn’t know the nature of the job or where it was,” Saito said. “I just knew that he seemed to think it was a great opportunity.”</p><p>Over the next few months, Denman stayed in sporadic touch. A text message here. A phone call there. He remained circumspect about his job.</p><p>“I’d ask, ‘Is everything okay?’ And he’d say, ‘I feel like this is my calling.

People were still making plans. There were parties. When animals talked, as animals in comics do, they said nothing about quarantines.One of the first voices to speak of the new normal belonged to Barry Taylor Wilkins, the younger of two brothers in Ray Billingsley’s long-running strip “Curtis.” It was on Monday, March 30, and we see Barry and Curtis’ mother, Diane Wilkins, squeezing hand sanitizer on her boys’ hands.“Why do I have to put this stuff on my hands, Mommy?” asks Barry.In “Curtis,” it is common for such questions to have both simple and complex answers. Since debuting the strip in 1988, Billingsley has mixed lighthearted gags with occasionally stark portrayals of the Wilkins, a middle-class African-American family, and their larger community of family, friends, barbers, and teachers. In “Curtis,” realism sneaks up on you: the family’s third-floor apartment can feel cramped; the father, Greg Wilkins, is uninspired by his job; and young brothers Barry and Curtis have real stresses, like fear of guns in school.On this day, Curtis tells his brother the sanitizer is to clean his fingers before picking his nose. But we know the real reason. So does Diane. The boys don’t. But that will change.Little Nemo Was the Most Beautiful Comic Strip Ever DrawnAt four panels a day, time moves slowly in a daily comic, even when events in other newspaper pages move alarmingly fast. As March finally gave way to April, the Wilkins family were seen adapting to their little corner of the pandemic. There are jokes about home-schooling and cabin fever. Greg tries to cheer his sons up with a theatrical display of pancake-making, flipping them with a juggler’s flare. “I try my best to shield my boys,” Greg will say to Diane. “And that is why I love you always,” thinks Diane.Then, in the middle of breakfast, the Wilkins’ lives change again. Curtis receives a phone call. He walks back into the kitchen, dazed. His stack of pancakes is still waiting for him, untouched.“It’s our teacher, Mrs. Nelson,” Curtis says. “She tested positive for coronavirus.” * * *“I don’t want to start much trouble, but sometimes I can’t help myself,” Ray Billingsley told me in a recent phone interview from his home in Stanford, Connecticut, where he has been hunkered down with his basset hound, Biscuit. “It’s the artist in me.”Although a few new comics starring people of color have debuted in recent years, “Curtis” remains one of the few daily syndicated strips centered around black characters. Billingsley sees himself following in the tradition of Morrie Turner’s “Wee Pals” and Ted Shearer’s “Quincy”—and also Aaron McGruder’s “Boondocks,” but with a difference. “‘Boondocks’ was in your face, and he didn’t care how much,” Billingsley said. “The rest of us, we have to walk a tightrope.”Billingsley tested that tightrope when the Wilkins family noticed that Barry was slipping milk out of the house. They thought he was feeding a cat but followed him and found instead an abandoned baby. In another strip, Diane miscarried after being assaulted at an ATM. “Nobody was expecting a miscarriage in ‘Curtis,’” Billingsley said.One of the slyest moments in “Curtis” happened when the Wilkins family and friends were invited to Dagwood and Blondie Bumstead’s house, as part of a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the comic strip “Blondie.” They took a wrong turn and ended up in Mary Worth’s neighborhood. There, they discovered how fast police response time can be in a different part of town.Billingsley often pushes against his six-week deadline to allow him the chance to comment on current events. Yet the experience of drawing “Curtis” during COVID-19 feels different than anything he has done before. “This one I’m going by instinct. I said, ‘It’s time to do it right now.’ I kept seeing that nobody was addressing this.”I asked if he felt a special weight in his decision to have a character contract the illness. “Actually, I’ve been feeling the weight of this entire story,” he said. “I have to really get into what everyone was feeling. We’re talking about a core of four people and how it’s really affecting them as a unit. I’m not showing anyone else. It’s just about this family right now.”“This has been one of the harder ones to draw. I had the flapjack party going on and I knew something was going to come up. When Curtis comes into the room, it hit me then, too. It made me depressed. I do it to myself. They’re so much from the heart that they can hurt me first. If I’m hit on an emotional level, I’m pretty sure other people will be too.”* * *People don’t usually die on the funny pages. It’s only possible in what’s called a “continuity” strip, one in which a narrative might stretch over many days or weeks. After all, Beetle Bailey can get beaten to a pulp and spring back up the next day, and nobody questions it. “In Beetle’s world, it doesn’t matter who’s president, or what kind of disease is going around,” laughed Billingsley, who counted the late “Beetle Bailey” creator Mort Walker among his friends.The first major character to die in comics was Mary Gold, who in 1929 contracted a mysterious illness in the comic strip “The Gumps.” Since then, deaths have remained rare. In 2004, it came for the elderly Phyllis Blossom Wallet in “Gasoline Alley.” Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury” has featured several deaths, most controversially that of Andy Lippincott, who died of AIDS in 1990. Letters from readers poured in after the death of the family dog Farley in Lynn Johnston’s “For Better or For Worse.”You didn’t see any death scenes in the comics page during the so-called Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. Comics scholar Jared Gardner began searching through hundred-year-old newspapers for any comics that dealt with the outbreak and was surprised by how little he found. “Lots of words, lots of typing, but not lots of drawing,” Gardner said, speaking via Zoom from his home in Columbus, Ohio, where he serves as director of Popular Culture Studies at Ohio State University.Gardner put what he did find on his website “Drawing Blood,” which is dedicated to comics and medicine. There is a single Bud Fisher “Mutt and Jeff” comic with the punchline “I went home last night and opened the window and in flew Enza.” A few comics discuss wearing masks and avoiding crowds. Some subscribe to the xenophobia suggested by the misnamed “Spanish flu.” Others lightly mock it, as in George Herriman’s “Krazy Kat,” in which Krazy dreams of a Spanish bullfight and wakes up the next morning with the flu, which “may or may not disprove the ‘germ’ theory,” as Herriman wryly notes.  Gardner suspects that the oversized cultural influence of comic strips in 1918 might be why there were so few mentions of the flu. Cartoonists and their bosses knew they were being watched. As John M. Barry wrote in his history The Great Influenza, the Sedition Act promised jail time for anyone who dared “print, write or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the government of the United States.” This even extended to “pessimistic stories,” and the trial of leftist cartoonist Art Young for violating the Espionage Act had proven that the government reach might extend to cartoonists.It might have just been that most cartoonists didn’t think people wanted to see the flu in the funnies. Still, the few that did address it have a lesson to teach us. “It must have felt like the end of the world for these folks as surely as this time does for us,” Gardner said. “It can feel unprecedented and apocalyptic, but looking at comics from a hundred years ago reminds us that they got through it.”* * *The first widely syndicated newspaper comic to address COVID-19 was Bill Hinds’ “Tank McNamara,” a sports-themed strip that had to contend with the sudden absence of professional sports. “Curtis” followed shortly after. Cartoonist Stephan Pastis often makes himself a character in his smart and acerbic “Pearls Before Swine”; he drew his first coronavirus comics as if he were stranded with nothing but pencil and notepaper, playing off his real-life situation of being out of the country when the United States starting limiting travel. Meanwhile, a heartbreaking series in Darrin Bell’s “Candorville” tackled social isolation by showing full-panel cityscapes from throughout the world. The same thought arises in different languages from each house and apartment: “I am all alone.”Argentinian cartoonist Ricardo Siri, whose comic “Macanudo” is published in English under his pen name “Liniers,” says the strip was born out of time of social and economic crisis in Argentina. “My way of being punk was to be optimistic,” he said, talking to me by phone from his current home in Vermont, where he teaches at Dartmouth College. His coronavirus-themed work has been delicate and hopeful, often turning to the natural world for inspiration. In one full-panel strip, a girl and cat sit together, watching a butterfly make its way across a grassy field. The caption reads: “Taking care of each other will also be contagious.”“I feel like when people are drowning, you can either throw them a life vest or an anvil,” Siri said. “Every now and then I allow myself to be angry in the strip, or pessimistic, or nihilistic. But I think the reason the comics page first existed, from the Pulitzer and Hearst years, is to give people something so they don’t jump out the window.”In a sense, the visual representation of COVID-19 is itself a cartoon—a multi-colored illustration of a spike protein-studded ball created by Alissa Eckert and Dan Higgins for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (By contrast, Gardner notes that cartoonists in 1918 often used mosquitoes to represent the flu, due to the insects’ past association with sickness and death.) Eckert told The New York Times they were tasked with creating “an identity” for the coronavirus. But it took cartoonist Mark Tatulli to turn their image into a full-blown character. In Tatulli’s wincingly funny “Lio,” the Coronavirus might laugh menacingly or wait quietly in a doorway. In one chilling comic, it sits on the couch, watching the news. “It’s always weird seeing yourself on TV, ya know?” it says to a child.To Gardner, these novel approaches to the novel coronavirus are a sign of hope for comics themselves. “If you want a media that can talk about it right now, and both comfort and educate, what does it better?” he said. “There’s social media, which is evil, and there are comics. It’s a moment where the comic strip, editorial cartooning, and web comics can talk about stuff as it’s happening, and they can build space for community in the moment—which is part of why comics and cartooning became so important in the first place.”Added Gardner, “There’s a tone, a kind of intimacy, that the comic strip can capture that is really needed. I’m grateful for it.”* * *The most intimate moment in the current run of “Curtis” comes when Greg Wilkins is explaining to his son that because of social distancing, he can’t visit Mrs. Nelson in the hospital. Curtis pumps his fist and says, “Awwww, she’ll be all right!—Mrs. Nelson is a tough ol’ lady.” Greg smiles and holds his son. He praises him for his positive attitude. What he doesn’t see—but what is clearly visible to readers—is that Curtis is crying.I told Billingsley that this devotion of a student to a teacher reminded me of a series in Charles M. Schulz’s “Peanuts,” when Linus is watching his beloved teacher Miss Othmar during a teacher’s strike, and she falls down with exhaustion.“Remember, only Linus was close to Miss Othmar,” says Billingsley. “Lucy wasn’t. It can be a very special bond between a student and a certain teacher.”In fact, he said, Mrs. Nelson was the name of his own third-grade teacher. “I didn’t have the best home life, growing up. I had a father who was very strict. It got to the point where I looked forward to going to school, because I was away from my father. I was one of those weird kids who was good friends with the principal.“Mrs. Nelson was the first person who told my parents I had a career in artwork. She encouraged me, and from that time on I kept drawing.“So when Curtis put his head behind his father, I quietly cried to myself, because I knew I was going to do this.”Since that moment, there have been jokes in “Curtis” about Curtis saying that he’s bored and being handed a mop and bucket, and of Greg admitting to his son that he misses “being at work complaining about being at work.” But Billingsley said he’ll be returning to the story about Mrs. Nelson. He doesn’t know exactly when. Just like when it started, he said, he’ll be going by instinct.“When it’s time to wrap this story up, I’ll know it.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Since debuting the strip in 1988, Billingsley has mixed lighthearted gags with occasionally stark portrayals of the Wilkins, a middle-class African-American family, and their larger community of family, friends, barbers, and teachers. In “Curtis,” realism sneaks up on you: the family’s third-floor apartment can feel cramped; the father, Greg Wilkins, is uninspired by his job; and young brothers Barry and Curtis have real stresses, like fear of guns in school.</p><p>On this day, Curtis tells his brother the sanitizer is to clean his fingers before picking his nose. But we know the real reason. So does Diane. The boys don’t.

Greg tries to cheer his sons up with a theatrical display of pancake-making, flipping them with a juggler’s flare. “I try my best to shield my boys,” Greg will say to Diane. “And that is why I love you always,” thinks Diane.</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:30%;\"><img alt=\'&lt;div class=\"inline-image__credit\"&gt; Curtis © 2020 King Features Syndicate Inc., World Rights Reserved &lt;/div&gt;\' class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4gUqp3XXBaClahF9YHHm5Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTIxNC4yMTE1Mzg0NjE1Mzg0NQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mac11ZS8BIoLWqckAR0iqQ--~B/aD0xMTg1O3c9MzkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/f635702125a3a1043a53dda1feae693f\" src=\"\"/><noscript><img alt=\'&lt;div class=\"inline-image__credit\"&gt; Curtis © 2020 King Features Syndicate Inc., World Rights Reserved &lt;/div&gt;\' class=\"caas-img\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4gUqp3XXBaClahF9YHHm5Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTIxNC4yMTE1Mzg0NjE1Mzg0NQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mac11ZS8BIoLWqckAR0iqQ--~B/aD0xMTg1O3c9MzkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/f635702125a3a1043a53dda1feae693f\"/></noscript></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\"><div class=\"inline-image__credit\"> Curtis © 2020 King Features Syndicate Inc., World Rights Reserved </div></figcaption></figure><p>Then, in the middle of breakfast, the Wilkins’ lives change again.

Billingsley sees himself following in the tradition of Morrie Turner’s “Wee Pals” and Ted Shearer’s “Quincy”—and also Aaron McGruder’s “Boondocks,” but with a difference. “‘Boondocks’ was in your face, and he didn’t care how much,” Billingsley said. “The rest of us, we have to walk a tightrope.”</p><p>Billingsley tested that tightrope when the Wilkins family noticed that Barry was slipping milk out of the house. They thought he was feeding a cat but followed him and found instead an abandoned baby. In another strip, Diane miscarried after being assaulted at an ATM. “Nobody was expecting a miscarriage in ‘Curtis,’” Billingsley said.</p><p>One of the slyest moments in “Curtis” happened when the Wilkins family and friends were invited to Dagwood and Blondie Bumstead’s house, as part of a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the comic strip “Blondie.” They took a wrong turn and ended up in Mary Worth’s neighborhood. There, they discovered how fast police response time can be in a different part of town.</p><p>Billingsley often pushes against his six-week deadline to allow him the chance to comment on current events. Yet the experience of drawing “Curtis” during COVID-19 feels different than anything he has done before. “This one I’m going by instinct. I said, ‘It’s time to do it right now.’ I kept seeing that nobody was addressing this.”</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:30%;\"><img alt=\'&lt;div class=\"inline-image__credit\"&gt; Curtis © 2020 King Features Syndicate Inc., World Rights Reserved &lt;/div&gt;\' class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PgFrgLFx1L4QVY1.6NQIag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTIxNC41NzMwNzY5MjMwNzY5/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dUt012ygnm7VKPqgh4VcdA--~B/aD0xMTg3O3c9MzkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/98e013bd3401361a6e855a2c8002b8ca\" src=\"\"/><noscript><img alt=\'&lt;div class=\"inline-image__credit\"&gt; Curtis © 2020 King Features Syndicate Inc., World Rights Reserved &lt;/div&gt;\' class=\"caas-img\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PgFrgLFx1L4QVY1.6NQIag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTIxNC41NzMwNzY5MjMwNzY5/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dUt012ygnm7VKPqgh4VcdA--~B/aD0xMTg3O3c9MzkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/98e013bd3401361a6e855a2c8002b8ca\"/></noscript></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\"><div class=\"inline-image__credit\"> Curtis © 2020 King Features Syndicate Inc., World Rights Reserved </div></figcaption></figure><p>I asked if he felt a special weight in his decision to have a character contract the illness. “Actually, I’ve been feeling the weight of this entire story,” he said. “I have to really get into what everyone was feeling. We’re talking about a core of four people and how it’s really affecting them as a unit. I’m not showing anyone else. It’s just about this family right now.”</p><p>“This has been one of the harder ones to draw. I had the flapjack party going on and I knew something was going to come up. When Curtis comes into the room, it hit me then, too. It made me depressed. I do it to myself. They’re so much from the heart that they can hurt me first. If I’m hit on an emotional level, I’m pretty sure other people will be too.”</p><p>People don’t usually die on the funny pages. It’s only possible in what’s called a “continuity” strip, one in which a narrative might stretch over many days or weeks. After all, Beetle Bailey can get beaten to a pulp and spring back up the next day, and nobody questions it. “In Beetle’s world, it doesn’t matter who’s president, or what kind of disease is going around,” laughed Billingsley, who counted the late “Beetle Bailey” creator Mort Walker among his friends.</p><p>The first major character to die in comics was Mary Gold, who in 1929 contracted a mysterious illness in the comic strip “The Gumps.” Since then, deaths have remained rare. In 2004, it came for the elderly Phyllis Blossom Wallet in “Gasoline Alley.” Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury” has featured several deaths, most controversially that of Andy Lippincott, who died of AIDS in 1990. Letters from readers poured in after the death of the family dog Farley in Lynn Johnston’s “For Better or For Worse.”</p><p>You didn’t see any death scenes in the comics page during the so-called Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. Comics scholar Jared Gardner began searching through hundred-year-old newspapers for any comics that dealt with the outbreak and was surprised by how little he found. “Lots of words, lots of typing, but not lots of drawing,” Gardner said, speaking via Zoom from his home in Columbus, Ohio, where he serves as director of Popular Culture Studies at Ohio State University.</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:36%;\"><img alt=\'&lt;div class=\"inline-image__credit\"&gt; Public Domain &lt;/div&gt;\' class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HvOiE.HmhjLE4TntRLp7CA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTI1My44MTgzNTkzNzU-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2xnZ_sWdje9oC_4qMJxJWg--~B/aD01NTM7dz0xNTM2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/38269f9f7aee4c60137be313da33ddc0\" src=\"\"/><noscript><img alt=\'&lt;div class=\"inline-image__credit\"&gt; Public Domain &lt;/div&gt;\' class=\"caas-img\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HvOiE.HmhjLE4TntRLp7CA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTI1My44MTgzNTkzNzU-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2xnZ_sWdje9oC_4qMJxJWg--~B/aD01NTM7dz0xNTM2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/38269f9f7aee4c60137be313da33ddc0\"/></noscript></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\"><div class=\"inline-image__credit\"> Public Domain </div></figcaption></figure><p>Gardner put what he did find on<a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:his website “Drawing Blood,”\" href=\"http://drawing-blood.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> his website “Drawing Blood,”</a> which is dedicated to comics and medicine.

Cartoonists and their bosses knew they were being watched. As John M. Barry wrote in his history <em>The Great Influenza</em>, the Sedition Act promised jail time for anyone who dared “print, write or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the government of the United States.” This even extended to “pessimistic stories,” and the trial of leftist cartoonist Art Young for violating the Espionage Act had proven that the government reach might extend to cartoonists.</p><p>It might have just been that most cartoonists didn’t think people wanted to see the flu in the funnies. Still, the few that did address it have a lesson to teach us. “It must have felt like the end of the world for these folks as surely as this time does for us,” Gardner said. “It can feel unprecedented and apocalyptic, but looking at comics from a hundred years ago reminds us that they got through it.”</p><p>The first widely syndicated newspaper comic to address COVID-19 was Bill Hinds’ “Tank McNamara,” a sports-themed strip that had to contend with the sudden absence of professional sports. “Curtis” followed shortly after. Cartoonist Stephan Pastis often makes himself a character in his smart and acerbic “Pearls Before Swine”; he drew his first coronavirus comics as if he were stranded with nothing but pencil and notepaper, playing off his real-life situation of being out of the country when the United States starting limiting travel. Meanwhile, a heartbreaking series in Darrin Bell’s “Candorville” tackled social isolation by showing full-panel cityscapes from throughout the world. The same thought arises in different languages from each house and apartment: “I am all alone.”</p><p>Argentinian cartoonist Ricardo Siri, whose comic “Macanudo” is published in English under his pen name “Liniers,” says the strip was born out of time of social and economic crisis in Argentina. “My way of being punk was to be optimistic,” he said, talking to me by phone from his current home in Vermont, where he teaches at Dartmouth College. His coronavirus-themed work has been delicate and hopeful, often turning to the natural world for inspiration. In one full-panel strip, a girl and cat sit together, watching a butterfly make its way across a grassy field. The caption reads: “Taking care of each other will also be contagious.”</p><p>“I feel like when people are drowning, you can either throw them a life vest or an anvil,” Siri said. “Every now and then I allow myself to be angry in the strip, or pessimistic, or nihilistic. But I think the reason the comics page first existed, from the Pulitzer and Hearst years, is to give people something so they don’t jump out the window.”</p><p>In a sense, the visual representation of COVID-19 is itself a cartoon—a multi-colored illustration of a spike protein-studded ball created by Alissa Eckert and Dan Higgins for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (By contrast, Gardner notes that cartoonists in 1918 often used mosquitoes to represent the flu, due to the insects’ past association with sickness and death.) Eckert told The New York Times they were tasked with creating “an identity” for the coronavirus. But it took cartoonist Mark Tatulli to turn their image into a full-blown character. In Tatulli’s wincingly funny “Lio,” the Coronavirus might laugh menacingly or wait quietly in a doorway. In one chilling comic, it sits on the couch, watching the news. “It’s always weird seeing yourself on TV, ya know?” it says to a child.</p><p>To Gardner, these novel approaches to the novel coronavirus are a sign of hope for comics themselves. “If you want a media that can talk about it right now, and both comfort and educate, what does it better?” he said. “There’s social media, which is evil, and there are comics. It’s a moment where the comic strip, editorial cartooning, and web comics can talk about stuff as it’s happening, and they can build space for community in the moment—which is part of why comics and cartooning became so important in the first place.”</p><p>Added Gardner, “There’s a tone, a kind of intimacy, that the comic strip can capture that is really needed. I’m grateful for it.”</p><p>The most intimate moment in the current run of “Curtis” comes when Greg Wilkins is explaining to his son that because of social distancing, he can’t visit Mrs. Nelson in the hospital. Curtis pumps his fist and says, “Awwww, she’ll be all right!—Mrs. Nelson is a tough ol’ lady.” </p><p>Greg smiles and holds his son. He praises him for his positive attitude. What he doesn’t see—but what is clearly visible to readers—is that Curtis is crying.</p><p>I told Billingsley that this devotion of a student to a teacher reminded me of a series in Charles M. Schulz’s “Peanuts,” when Linus is watching his beloved teacher Miss Othmar during a teacher’s strike, and she falls down with exhaustion.</p><p>“Remember, only Linus was close to Miss Othmar,” says Billingsley. “Lucy wasn’t. It can be a very special bond between a student and a certain teacher.”</p><p>In fact, he said, Mrs. Nelson was the name of his own third-grade teacher. “I didn’t have the best home life, growing up. I had a father who was very strict. It got to the point where I looked forward to going to school, because I was away from my father. I was one of those weird kids who was good friends with the principal.</p><p>“Mrs. Nelson was the first person who told my parents I had a career in artwork. She encouraged me, and from that time on I kept drawing.</p><p>“So when Curtis put his head behind his father, I quietly cried to myself, because I knew I was going to do this.”</p><p>Since that moment, there have been jokes in “Curtis” about Curtis saying that he’s bored and being handed a mop and bucket, and of Greg admitting to his son that he misses “being at work complaining about being at work.” But Billingsley said he’ll be returning to the story about Mrs. Nelson. He doesn’t know exactly when. Just like when it started, he said, he’ll be going by instinct.</p><p>“When it’s time to wrap this story up, I’ll know it.”</p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Read more at The Daily Beast.\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-curtis-tackled-the-coronavirus-in-a-newspaper-comic?source=articles&amp;via=rss\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read more at The Daily Beast.</a></p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

She filed an amendment in March to correct an error, but two weeks later she got a notice that her return was being audited. Since then, she said she has heard nothing about her refund or her stimulus check.</p><p>“Everything is on hold,” she said. “I can’t do anything.”</p><p>Anthony Mailloux of Dallas is owed $10,177 in a tax refund and stimulus. He sent paperwork to the IRS in February to resolve some issues on the tax return he filed a month earlier. The IRS already had his direct deposit information from where he had previously filed his taxes, so he assumed his stimulus check would show up when the government started sending them out in April.</p><p>It didn’t. Neither has his tax return. He went to the IRS website and re-entered his information. Still, no tax refund or stimulus.</p><p>Mailloux, a student with two children, has started an <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:online petition\" href=\"https://www.change.org/p/internal-revenue-service-the-forgotten-15thers?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=8e6cadb0-20b3-11e5-a067-017fcb90d1d8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online petition</a> that he intends to send to the IRS to bring attention to the problem.

But “moving forward, I’m not sure where that money is going to come from,” she said. “It’s either I pay my rent or I pay all of my utilities. I don’t know how I’m going to do that yet.”</p><p>Stephanie Dann, a mother of three from Millsboro, Delaware, said she has contacted the IRS multiple times about the $6,000 tax refund and $3,900 stimulus check she and her husband are owed. One agent said the missing stimulus check had nothing to do with her husband’s tax issues. Another suggested the opposite and said a hold on their taxes could in fact be delaying their stimulus.</p><p>“We don’t even know what the actual truth is because we’ve been getting different information from different agents,” she said. “It’s ridiculous.

Wanda Vázquez announced on Saturday that she will hold a nonbinding referendum in November to decide whether Puerto Rico should become a U.S. state, a move that comes amid growing disillusion with the island’s U.S. territorial status.</p><p>For the first time in the island’s history, the referendum will ask a single, simple question: Should Puerto Rico be immediately admitted as a U.S. state?</p><p>It’s an answer that requires approval from U.S. Congress and a question that outraged the island’s small group of independence supporters and members of the main opposition Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo. But it’s a gamble that members of the governor’s pro-statehood party are confident will pay off given that Puerto Rico has struggled to obtain federal funds for hurricanes Irma and Maria, a string of recent strong earthquakes and the coronavirus pandemic amid growing complaints that the island does not receive fair and equal treatment.</p><p>“Everything important in life carries some risk,” said former Puerto Rico governor Carlos Romero Barceló, a member of the Progressive New Party.</p><p>Previous referendums have presented voters with more than one question or various options, including independence or upholding the current territorial status, but none have been so direct as the one scheduled to be held during the Nov. 3 general elections.</p><p>“Our people will have the opportunity once and for all to define our future,” Vázquez said. “It’s never too late to be treated as equals.”</p><p>Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. And while the island is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes and receives less federal funding than U.S. states. Many believe the island’s territorial status has contributed to its struggle to recover from the hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as worsened its economic crisis, largely caused by decades of heavy borrowing and the elimination of federal tax incentives.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>U.S. Congress would have to accept the referendum results for it to move forward, and it has never acted on the island’s previous five referendums. The last one, held in 2017, was hit by a boycott and a low turnout that raised questions about the vote’s legitimacy. More than half a million people favored statehood in that referendum, followed by nearly 7,800 votes for free association/independence and more than 6,800 votes for the current territorial status.

McPherson confirmed earlier this week that senior government officials had approved the waiver. Navy spokesperson Lt. Brittany Stephens said the sailor, known only as \"Jane Doe\" in media reports and court documents, “requested a waiver to serve in their preferred gender” and will be “allowed to adhere to standards associated with their preferred gender, such as uniforms and grooming,” <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:according to CNN\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/navy-first-waiver-transgender/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to CNN</a>, which was the first to report on the waiver.</p><p>SPART*A, an organization that advocates for transgender service members, said in a statement that the organization is “ecstatic” about the Navy’s announcement, hoping it could pave the way for more transgender people to serve openly in the armed forces.</p><p>“I am hopeful that this is the first of many,” said SPART*A President Emma Shinn, “but the fight is far from over.”</p><p>It has been a long fight for advocacy groups to reach even this milestone. Jane Doe\'s request has been the only one of its kind granted since President Donald Trump announced in July 2017 that he intended to prohibit transgender troops from serving openly in the military, reversing a year-old policy from the prior administration. Although the ban was initially blocked in a series of federal court rulings, the Supreme Court eventually lifted those injunctions.</p><p>Guidelines unveiled in March 2018 <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:permitted transgender people to remain in active duty\" href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/03/24/here-is-the-mattis-guidance-and-pentagon-study-behind-trump-transgender-decision/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">permitted transgender people to remain in active duty</a> if they served in accordance with their “biological sex” or received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a medical professional before April 2019, when the <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:ban officially went into effect\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-controversial-transgender-military-policy-goes-effect-n993826\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ban officially went into effect</a>.

Jennifer Levi, transgender rights project director for GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders and one of Jane Doe\'s attorneys, noted in a statement that dozens of other “equally qualified transgender service members … have sought waivers and are still in limbo, despite being perfectly fit to serve.”</p><p>Levi said the Navy only granted the waiver after Jane Doe, a naval officer who came out two months after the military ban went into effect, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:filed a lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court\" href=\"https://notransmilitaryban.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ECF-1_Complaint.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed a lawsuit in a Massachusetts federal court</a> in March: Doe v. Esper. While the five other legal challenges brought as a result of Trump’s military ban sought to overturn the policy, Jane Doe was merely seeking to continue her service. She has been a member of the Navy since 2011.</p><p>“Dedicated military service members shouldn’t have to bring a lawsuit to be able to continue doing their job,” Levi said.</p><p>While LGBTQ advocacy groups remain optimistic that this first step could lead to positive developments in the push to reverse Trump’s ban on transgender people serving openly, some felt the move could be an attempt by the White House to neutralize legal arguments against the policy.</p><p>Peter Perkowski, legal and policy director for the <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Modern Military Association of America\" href=\"https://modernmilitary.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Military Association of America</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ military service members and veterans, argued the Trump administration “may attempt to weaponize the decision by falsely claiming the ban isn\'t a ban.”</p><p>“MMAA is committed to ensuring the unconscionable … transgender military ban is overturned and any qualified transgender patriot is free to serve openly and authentically,” Perkowski said in a statement.</p><p>Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights and an attorney for Jane Doe, said the plaintiff’s ultimate success in having her waiver approved doesn’t change the fact that the policy discriminates against trans people who hope to serve in accordance with their gender identity. NCLR is one of several LGBTQ advocacy groups that has fought against the trans military ban in court, along with Lambda Legal, GLAD and MMAA.</p><p>“There is no basis for treating transgender service members differently by requiring them to seek a waiver that no one else has to obtain in order to continue to serve,” Minter said in a statement.</p><p>A 2016 study commissioned by the Department of Defense <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:concluded that allowing trans people\" href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2016/06/30.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">concluded that allowing trans people</a> to serve openly and in accordance with their gender identity would have “minimal impact on readiness and health care costs,” noting the number of transgender service members “would likely be a small fraction of the total force.”</p><p><em><strong>Follow <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:NBC Out\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NBC Out</a> on <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/NBCOUT\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NBCOUT/?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> &amp; <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Instagram\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nbcout/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></strong> </em></p></div>',0,'rss'),(666,'Nevada Rep.

It is clear that it is a bubble.”</p><p>Global stock markets have seen rapid swings amid the coronavirus pandemic. The crisis has sent U.S. unemployment surging to 14.7%, a level last seen during the Great Depression. Benchmark Brent crude prices, trading over $70 a barrel a year ago, now hovers just over $20 a barrel as demand collapses amid an oversupplied market.</p><p>But that hasn\'t slowed in the Tehran Stock Exchange. Founded in 1967, the market lists some 1,000 companies, including major firms like car manufacturer Iran Khodro. The bourse now has a market cap of more than $200 billion. And its daily 5% gains haven\'t gone unnoticed by ordinary Iranians.</p><p>“I visited the related office for several days to receive my Sejam code to get able to trade,” said Mohammad Reza Mansouri, who makes deliveries using his personal van. “The office was crowded with people like me.”</p><p>The exchange lists a half-million active traders out of some 12 million people who registered to buy and sell stocks.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>“An everyday 5% percent is very sexy,” said Abdollah Rahmani, a retired bank employee who trades stocks. ”What other market makes such a profit?”</p><p>Even President Hassan Rouhani, beleaguered since U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from his 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, has pointed to the market as a rare bright spot for the country. Iran\'s rial currency has fallen to 160,000 to 1 against the U.S. dollar, as opposed to the 35,000 to $1 in 2015.</p><p>“As Iran’s bourse has developed, (our enemies) become nervous and asked why the market is developing while markets in the world are in chaos,” Rouhani said at a Cabinet meeting last month. This rise \"is because of efforts by all companies, business people and fortunately offering shares of big companies to the stock market.”</p><p>The stock market rise in part takes root in how Iran\'s economy has changed in the decades since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Immediately after taking power, Iran\'s Shiite theocracy seized large private industries, putting them in large trusts, or bonyads. The bloody 1980s war with Iraq saw Iran further nationalize its economy.</p><p>In the 1990s, Iran began a privatization effort. The stock market became one way to accomplish this, with former hard-line populist President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad giving out so-called “Justice Shares” in firms to the poor. Some 50 million Iranians now hold those shares.</p><p>But Ahmadinejad\'s efforts at privatization also saw firms sold off to the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and its allies, further empowering the hard-line force answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Some firms that moved into private ownership have seen the businesses stripped and later collapse, leaving workers without pensions and fueling sporadic protests.</p><p>Lower returns in other investments also are sending people to the stock market.</p><p>“The rise in liquidity in Iran’s financial market has made people expect high inflation in future,\" said Reza Khanaki, a Tehran-based financial analyst and manager. “Their bank deposits are yielding profits less than the inflation rate, and so they are shifting their investments to the stock market. This change is causing the rise in the index.”</p><p>Squeezed by U.S. sanctions, Rouhani\'s government hopes to raise money through selling assets on the exchange. His government in January also allowed firms to recalculate their values, something critics warn masks the true worth of their production by instead inflating the price of land they own, for instance.</p><p>“The Iranian financial press as well as foreign economists have raised concerns that the meteoric rise of the market is detached from the underlying value of the assets traded there and that bubbles have formed,” said Henry Rome, an analyst at the Eurasia Group. “The government’s decision to focus privatization attention on the market has elevated these risks. A loss of confidence in the market could lead to a destabilizing crash.”</p><p>Iranian political analyst Akbar Mokhtari warns it could be even worse, comparing the “Justice Shares” to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi\'s so-called “White Revolution” in the 1960s that broke up the control of feudal land barons and saw the poor rush into cities. Those poor became the backbone of the protests that later drove him from power.</p><p>“The other side of this very important economic development can be the impatience of shareholders about possible crashes that can cause instability in the government,” he was quoted as saying by Rahbord, an Iranian political review channel on Telegram.</p><p>Already, the exchange has seen some stumbles. On Saturday, the market closed at 987,475 points, down some 60,300 points compared to last Monday, when it reached a record high of over 1 million points.</p><p>But some, like Mansouri, the stock-trading deliveryman, say those fears don\'t bother them.</p><p>“I do not care about the analysis as long as I profit day by day,\" he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists Mehdi

countries, limited testing capacity and the difficulty of finding and identifying asymptomatic cases has likely caused many patients to go undiagnosed. COVID-19 tests can also produce false negatives if they aren\'t administered properly or if a patient isn\'t shedding enough virus to be detected in a sample.</p><p>Some public-health experts have suggested that the <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:actual case totals in Italy and the US\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-number-of-coronavirus-cases-underreported-us-china-italy-2020-4?utm_source=yahoo.com&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">actual case totals in Italy and the US</a> could be at least 10 times higher than the current figures. Death counts are likely to be inaccurately low as well.</p><p>\"There are a lot of deaths that we probably will never know if they were coronavirus deaths or not,\" Elizabeth Halloran, a biostatistician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, told Business Insider. \"There could be a lot more people infected than we thought.\"</p><p>Data from the Italian research group Istituto Cattaneo now suggests that the number of coronavirus deaths in Italy was <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:almost double the total reported\" href=\"https://www.cattaneo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Colombo-Impicciatore-Covid-09_eng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">almost double the total reported</a> by the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of April 1.</p><p>Data from the US is less complete, but many states have reported spikes in excess deaths that have yet to be attributed to the virus, suggesting that the actual number of coronavirus deaths could be around 30% higher. In some states, total fatalities could be twice the current count.</p><h2>Italian provinces substantially underreported their outbreaks</h2><p>To quantify the true number of fatalities in Italy, the Istituto Cattaneo compared the number of reported deaths from February 21 to March 21 to the average number of deaths during that same time period from 2015 to 2019.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>According to data from the Italian Department of Civil Protection, Italy saw around 4,800 coronavirus deaths across more than 1,000 municipalities from February to March. But in total, these municipalities recorded 8,700 deaths outside the normal average — meaning thousands of excess deaths have yet to be explained.</p><p>In Lombardy, the northern region where Italy\'s first case was reported, the number of recorded deaths was more than double the average from the past five years.

Yet in March, the municipality saw more deaths than in any single year since 2012; the death count that month was 15 times higher than the monthly average between January 2012 and February 2020.</p><p>\"Reporting of confirmed COVID-19 specific deaths represents, at least for some Italian regions, a substantial underestimation of the actual number of deaths from the disease,\" the researchers wrote.</p><p>Other northern regions, like Emilia-Romagna, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Piedmont, saw their death counts rise by more than 50%, the Istituto Cattaneo found.</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:67%;\"><img alt=\"A worker sanitizes the Piazza dei Miracoli near the Tower of Pisa in Pisa, Italy, on March 17 2020.\" class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zxIJAJkFLPAf23yWDVjKSQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ2OS4yMTY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NA--/https://media.zenfs.com/EN/business_insider_articles_888/e2f10d85be8416082fd4f99ca1322ba8\" src=\"\"/><noscript><img alt=\"A worker sanitizes the Piazza dei Miracoli near the Tower of Pisa in Pisa, Italy, on March 17 2020.\" class=\"caas-img\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zxIJAJkFLPAf23yWDVjKSQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ2OS4yMTY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NA--/https://media.zenfs.com/EN/business_insider_articles_888/e2f10d85be8416082fd4f99ca1322ba8\"/></noscript></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\">A worker sanitizes the Piazza dei Miracoli near the Tower of Pisa in Pisa, Italy, on March 17 2020.</figcaption></figure><p>Laura Lezza/Getty Images</p><p>Even southern regions outside the epicenter of Italy\'s crisis saw higher-than-average death counts from February to March.

The declassified document also states that the unmasking requests were approved through the National Security Agency’s “standard process.”</p><p>This past week, when Trump was asked by reporters to define Obama’s criminal offense in the alleged “Obamagate,” Trump failed to articulate one. “You know what the crime is,” he said last Monday. “The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.”</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>During routine surveillance of foreign targets, names of Americans occasionally come up in conversation, either because the foreigner is talking to or about them. For privacy reasons, those names are generally concealed, or masked, before the intelligence is distributed to administration officials. U.S. officials can ask the agency that collected the intelligence to unmask the name if they think it is vital to understanding the intelligence.</p><p>While Trump casts unmasking as sinister, the number of identities unmasked in response to such requests has actually increased during the first years of the Trump administration from the final year of the Obama administration.</p><p>___</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: “The unmasking of General Flynn by the Obama Administration regarding conversations during the presidential transition are deeply troubling and smell of politics, not national security.” — statement Wednesday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There is nothing from newly released material that suggests the unmasking requests were rooted in politics rather than national security.</p><p>There were indeed multiple Obama administration officials, including then-Vice President Biden, who asked the NSA to disclose the name of an American whose identity was concealed in intelligence reports. That American was revealed to be Flynn.</p><p>But there’s nothing inherently unusual about the requests, and the documents released by the Trump administration say the people who made the requests were authorized to receive the underlying intelligence reports.</p><p>___</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY: “But it should be and is illegal to listen to an American’s conversation. And it’s even worse if you’re listening to an American who just happens to be your political opponent from the opposite party.” — interview Wednesday on Fox News Channel.</p><p>THE FACTS: It is not illegal to listen to an American’s conversations, and law enforcement officials do it routinely with a warrant or court order. But in any event, that’s not what happened here.</p><p>No one was listening intentionally to an American’s conversation. Instead, U.S. officials learned of the conversations that involved or mentioned Flynn during surveillance of foreign targets.</p><p>___</p><p>TRUMP, addressing the criminal case against Flynn that Trump\'s Justice Department is now seeking to drop: “This was all Obama, this was all Biden. These people were corrupt, the whole thing was corrupt, and we caught them.” — interview Thursday on Fox Business Network.</p><p>THE FACTS: He’s suggesting partisan politics by the Obama administration were completely behind Flynn’s investigation. That\'s incorrect.</p><p>It is true that the counterintelligence investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, and into Russia in particular, began during the Obama administration. But it continued well into Trump’s own administration. The investigation into Flynn was taken over by a special counsel who was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, Trump’s own deputy attorney general.</p><p>___</p><p>‘OBAMAGATE’</p><p>NAVARRO: “Joe Biden has got 40 years of sucking up to the Chinese, including the eight years as vice president. And we know about the billion dollars that his son took from the Chinese.” — interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”</p><p>TRUMP: “Worst of all, was the last eight years under President Obama and Biden, where his son gets a billion and a half dollars, and then they’re supposed to be tough on China. ... And he walked out of China with $1.5 billion dollars to invest for them, of which he makes hundreds of thousands — and actually millions — of dollars.” — Fox interview Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There’s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated.</p><p>In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That’s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it.</p><p>Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, wrote in an internet post last year that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time “based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.”</p><p>“He has not received any return on his investment,” Mesires said.</p><p>Hunter Biden stepped down from the Chinese board last October as part of a pledge not to work on behalf of any foreign-owned companies should his father win the presidency.</p><p>___</p><p>TRUMP: “So even before I got elected, you remember the famous — the two lovers, right, Strzok and Page, the insurance policy, she’s going to win, but just in case she doesn’t we have an insurance policy. That means that if I won, they’re going to try and take me out.” — Fox interview Thursday, which re-aired Sunday.</p><p>THE FACTS: There was no conspiracy afoot to take out Trump in the 2016 text message between two FBI employees.</p><p>Trump depicts the two as referring to a plot — or insurance policy — to oust him from office if he won the presidential election over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It’s apparent from the text that it wasn’t that.</p><p>Agent Peter Strzok and lawyer Lisa Page, both now gone from the bureau, said the text messages reflected a debate about how aggressively the FBI should investigate Trump and his campaign when expectations at the time were that he would lose anyway.</p><p>Strzok texted about something Page had said to the FBI’s deputy director, to the effect that “there’s no way he gets elected.” But Strzok argued that the FBI should not assume Clinton would win: “I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.” He likened the situation to “an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.” He has said he was not discussing a plot to drive Trump from office.</p><p>___</p><p>TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</p><p>NAVARRO, praising Trump\'s pandemic response: “This starting gun for the China pandemic started on Jan. 30 when President Trump had the courage to pull down the flights from China. ... So don’t tell me we lost February, because I was there. I’m right here. And this president was directing us to move as quickly as possible.” — interview Sunday on ABC\'s “This Week.”</p><p>TRUMP: “In January I put – and I was criticized by everybody including Dr. Fauci — I put in a wall. We put in a very strong wall. Only a small number of people were allowed in, and they were all U.S. citizens. I can’t tell a U.S. citizen, you can’t come back into your country. ... We actually acted very early.” — Fox interview Thursday.</p><p>THE FACTS: The travel restrictions he imposed on China in late January had other loopholes besides the exceptions for U.S. citizens. It was not a solid “wall” or total ban, as Trump and his trade adviser suggest.</p><p>There were <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:many gaps in containment\" href=\"https://apnews.com/e5544a45250434154d01cd54183a55a3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">many gaps in containment</a> and <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:initial delays in testing\" href=\"https://apnews.com/c335958b1f8f6a37b19b421bc7759722\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">initial delays in testing</a> in January and February, leading to the U.S. rising to No. 1 globally in the number of people infected by the coronavirus.</p><p>His order temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in China within the previous 14 days, with exceptions for U.S. citizens, but also their immediate family and permanent residents.</p><p>Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press the federal government was also slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from Europe, which helped drive the acceleration of U.S. outbreaks in February. Trump announced restrictions for many European countries in mid-March.</p><p>”I think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier,\" she said.</p><p>___</p><p>VIRUS TESTING</p><p>TRUMP: “We just cracked 10 million tests ... Ten million. ... If you look down here, these are other countries that have not done anywhere near what we’re doing. We’re double. If you add them up and double them, we’ve done more tests. But I can’t get the press to print that, unfortunately.” — remarks Wednesday with governors of Colorado and North Dakota.</p><p>TRUMP: “What we’ve done on testing, we’ve now tested more than the entire world put together.” — remarks Thursday to reporters.</p><p>THE FACTS: False. The U.S. has not tested more than all other countries combined, let alone double the number for the entire world. It also lags many countries in testing its population proportionally.</p><p>Together, just three countries — Russia, Germany and Italy — have reported more tests than the U.S.</p><p>This week, the U.S. had reported conducting more than 10 million tests since the pandemic began, after failing in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak. That compared with more than 23 million tests by the other countries in the top 10 of the testing count.</p><p>The U.S. was followed by Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain, Britain, India, United Arab Emirates, Turkey and France.</p><p>___</p><p>BRETT GIROIR, the federal health official overseeing U.S. testing: “Everybody who needs a test can get a test. ... If you’re symptomatic with a respiratory illness, that is an indication for a test and you can get a test. If you need to be contact traced, you can get a test.” — news briefing on May 11.</p><p>THE FACTS: Not according to public health experts, who say the U.S. is not near the testing level to safely reopen.</p><p>Researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute, for instance, said the U.S. should now be doing 900,000 tests a day to help stop the spread of the virus. Trump this week said the U.S. was doing about 300,000.</p><p>Giroir stressed that an adequate number of diagnostic tests were available for those with symptoms of COVID-19, but studies have shown many who get infected never show symptoms. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, has urged enough testing to include at the least asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently broadened its guidelines for coronavirus testing to include certain asymptomatic people who may be at higher risk.</p><p>More than 40 states are failing to test widely enough to reach the level needed to safely loosen stay-at-home orders, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by the Harvard Global Health Institute. The group includes four — Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Texas – that have already reopened.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Meghan Hoyer and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>EDITOR\'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.</p><p>___</p><p>Find AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheck</p><p>Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck</p></div>',0,'rss'),(675,'Fox News coronavirus coverage dropped by 20% as the network shifted to &#39;Obamagate&#39;

Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said in a statement that Rubio “has been a great partner on intelligence and national security issues” and he looks forward to working with him.</p><p>Rubio\'s promotion comes amid repeated tension between the White House and the intelligence community. Trump has fired, ousted or moved aside multiple officials in the last year, including the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who triggered the beginning of impeachment proceedings last year when he tried to warn Congress about a call between Trump and the president of Ukraine.</p><p>Trump has also repeatedly questioned the intelligence agencies\' conclusions that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections. The Senate panel endorsed that conclusion in a report last month — including that Russia had a preference for Trump — and Rubio has repeatedly warned that Russia could try again.</p><p>The Senate panel\'s report \"is another stark reminder of the threat foreign adversaries pose to our elections and the need to remain vigilant as we approach election season this November,” Rubio said after the report was released.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>The new chairman\'s first official act will be a closed-door committee vote Tuesday to approve the nomination of Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe as director of national intelligence. Ratcliffe would replace former DNI Dan Coats, who left the post last summer. A close ally of Trump\'s, Richard Grenell, is currently in the acting position.</p><p>Rubio has focused much of his Senate career on foreign policy, particularly Russia and China, and he is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel. He is also the chairman of the Senate small-business committee, where he has been negotiating relief measures during the coronavirus pandemic. In announcing Rubio\'s appointment to head the intelligence panel, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not say whether he would keep the small-business gavel.</p><p>McConnell said that Rubio is a “natural choice” and that congressional oversight was needed “to keep partisan bias and political interference\" out of intelligence matters.</p><p>“His care for our nation’s security, advocacy for our values and interests, and vigilance toward threats have earned a national reputation,” McConnell said. “On subjects ranging from China and Russia to Iran and North Korea to tyranny and unrest in our own hemisphere, Senator Rubio has been on the case for years.”</p><p>Rubio issued a short statement thanking McConnell for the post. \"I am grateful to Leader McConnell for his confidence in me to lead the Senate Intelligence Committee during Senator Burr’s absence from the chairmanship,” he said. “The committee has long been one that conducts its work seriously, and I look forward to continuing that tradition.”</p><p>The Justice Department is investigating whether Burr exploited advance information when he unloaded as much as $1.7 million in stocks in February, days before the coronavirus pandemic caused markets to plummet. Burr, who will remain on the committee, has denied any wrongdoing.</p></div>',0,'rss');

The president insisted that it has enormous benefits for patients either trying to prevent or already have COVID-19.”</p><p>The veteran Fox News anchor went on to note that while the president in the past has said “what have you got to lose” regarding taking the drug, several recent studies showed that vulnerable people do “have one thing to lose—their lives.”</p><p>Cavuto highlighted the results from clinical trials and extensive studies that revealed no noticeable efficacy in treating COVID-19, including a recent government-funded Veterans Affairs study that found more deaths associated with coronavirus patients who took the drug as a treatment.</p><p>“The VA study to which the president alluded wasn’t a loaded political one, it was a test on patients there,” Cavuto declared. “And those who took it in a vulnerable population including those with respiratory and other conditions, they died.”</p><p>“I want to stress again, If you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you,” the Fox host strongly stated. “I cannot stress that enough. This. Will. Kill.

One of them was labeled in spreadsheets as \"Parent Does Not Wish to Separate.\"</p><p>Friday\'s court filing indicates that migrant parents were recently asked, among other questions, whether they wished to be separated from their children, so the minors could be released to relatives or other sponsors.</p><p>On Thursday, groups that provide legal services at the three family detention centers ICE oversees in Texas and Pennsylvania said their clients were asked, without their attorneys\' knowledge, to choose between staying in detention indefinitely or allowing their children to be released to sponsors — without them. </p><p>The advocates accused ICE of presenting parents with this \"binary choice,\" a policy which could lead to family separation and that the administration has reportedly considered in the past to deter families from crossing the border. Prior to Friday\'s court filings, an ICE spokesperson said the agency had \"not implemented what has been referred to as \'binary choice\' at this time,\" and was instead \"exploring all options\" in response to federal litigation.</p><p>In one of the court filings Friday, a top ICE official said officers at the three family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania conducted \"parole determinations\" for all the children in its custody in response to an order late last month by the federal judge overseeing litigation related to the Flores Settlement Agreement, which governs the care of migrant minors in U.S. custody. </p><p>On April 24, Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles found that the government was violating that agreement and ordered it to \"make every effort to promptly and safely\" release the children in its custody who have suitable sponsors, don\'t pose a danger to themselves or others and are not flight risks.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>ICE\'s Juvenile Coordinator Deane Dougherty said in Friday\'s filing that the agency complied with Gee\'s order by questioning parents about possible sponsors for their children and other factors that would affect a decision to release detainees. Dougherty said officers used parole worksheets in use since 2017 and not any other forms during the review. She also said officers did not ask parents to waive the rights their children have under the Flores agreement.</p><p>Spreadsheets included with the filings show the agency only granted parole to five minors at the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. It\'s unclear if the children granted parole will be released with their parents, since the filings don\'t specify it. </p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:35%;\"><img alt=\"screen-shot-2020-05-16-at-4-17-03-pm.jpg \" class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sIUJyABALsZDXolPtcNNsg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTI0NS42MTI5MDMyMjU4MDY0Ng--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/8baf732b7d9f3b7defdb870a7215bf51\" src=\"\"/><noscript><img alt=\"screen-shot-2020-05-16-at-4-17-03-pm.jpg \" class=\"caas-img\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sIUJyABALsZDXolPtcNNsg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTI0NS42MTI5MDMyMjU4MDY0Ng--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/8baf732b7d9f3b7defdb870a7215bf51\"/></noscript></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\">screen-shot-2020-05-16-at-4-17-03-pm.jpg </figcaption></figure><p><span class=\"embed__caption\">Screenshot of Justice Department filing on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</span></p><p>The rest of the children were denied parole on the grounds that they were a flight risk, that parents did not wish to be separated from them, that they had orders of deportation and pending decisions from immigration judges or asylum adjudicators. Other reasons included that the children were involved in federal litigation or had \"Purposefully evaded U.S. Immigration Controls.\"</p><p>Reached for comment on Friday\'s filings, an ICE spokesperson said the agency \"has not instituted binary choice or separated any parents from their child pursuant to \'binary choice,\' and ICE has not implemented any new forms to conduct the new parole determinations as required by the court — any assertion to the contrary is plainly false.\" </p><p>ICE officials said the form used during the custody review was created in the wake of an order from Gee in 2017.</p><p>Peter Schey, one of the two attorneys who filed the original lawsuit that prompted the Flores agreement in 1997, said the parole review ICE conducted is not what Gee asked for. He said parents reported that they were given forms that were in English, even though most of them do not read the language.</p><p>Even though Flores only covers migrant minors, Schey said ICE has broad discretion to release their parents as well. He said the government should be reviewing whether to release children under the terms of the Flores agreement, not under parole, which U.S. laws say can only be granted in \"urgent\" humanitarian or public benefit circumstances.</p><p>\"(Parole) is highly discretionary,\" Schey said. \"Whereas the Flores Settlement, the release is not discretionary. It says, \'shall release\' unless the child is a flight risk.\"</p><p>Bridget Cambria, an immigration attorney who represents families held by ICE at the Berks Family Residential Center in Pennsylvania, said parents called her immediately after they were asked whether they would be willing to allow their children to be released without them. \"It startled them and they all said no,\" Cambria said. \"They were scared.\" </p><p>\"One mother told an officer, \'there\'s no way you\'re taking my only child away from me,\'\" Cambria told CBS News. \"Most of the mothers became very emotional and cried most of the day, because even though they said \'no,\' there was a fear that it didn\'t matter what they said.\"</p><p>Cambria said ICE could have avoided alarming parents by advising their lawyers that it would ask them these questions. \"For me, to ask a mother, which is what they did in Berks, to give up their one-year-old daughter, to me is unconscionable. I think that\'s why they need to be at least held to account.\"  </p><p>In a separate filing on Friday, the Justice Department lawyer representing ICE asked to file the spreadsheets under seal, citing privacy concerns.</p><p>The Flores agreement originally applied only to migrant children classified as unaccompanied. But in 2015, Gee ruled that \"accompanied\" children were also covered and that they should generally not be held in secure, unlicensed facilities with their families for more than 20 days. </p><p>The Trump administration has published a rule it hopes will supersede the Flores settlement and allow it to detain families indefinitely in detention centers that do not need a state license. Gee has so far blocked it from taking effect. </p><p>According to spreadsheets submitted Friday, many of the children in ICE custody with their families have been detained for more than 20 days; some since August 2019.</p><p>Advocates have been urging ICE to release all migrant families and most adults from detention during the coronavirus pandemic, saying detainees are at increased risk of contracting the virus while in congregate settings. The agency said in its court filings Friday that no staff or detainees at the family detention centers have tested positive for coronavirus. However, more than 980 single adults in ICE custody have tested positive for the virus, according to the agency\'s latest tally.</p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Now you can visit the Faroe Islands, virtually\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/now-you-can-visit-the-faroe-islands-virtually?ftag=YHFaf537c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Now you can visit the Faroe Islands, virtually</a></p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Maintaining pomp under COVID circumstances\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/maintaining-pomp-under-covid-circumstances?ftag=YHFaf537c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maintaining pomp under COVID circumstances</a></p><p><a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Looking back at the Mount St. Helens eruption\" href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/looking-back-at-the-mount-st-helens-eruption?ftag=YHFaf537c7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Looking back at the Mount St. Helens eruption</a></p></div>',0,'rss'),(695,'Pompeo warns China over interference with U.S. journalists in Hong Kong','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/pompeo-warns-china-over-interference-202500393.html\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HJ.pAET74XbeQEW0AVpSug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/400c7cbdb84db03e1d71649c9f6a2662\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Pompeo warns China over interference with U.S. journalists in Hong Kong\" align=\"left\" title=\"Pompeo warns China over interference with U.S. journalists in Hong Kong\" border=\"0\" ></a>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday he believed China had threatened to interfere with the work of U.S. journalists in Hong Kong, and warned Beijing that any decision impinging on Hong Kong\'s autonomy could affect the U.S. assessment of Hong Kong\'s status.  \"These journalists are members of a free press, not propaganda cadres, and their valuable reporting informs Chinese citizens and the world,\" Pompeo said in a statement.<p><br clear=\"all\">','<p><a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/pompeo-warns-china-over-interference-202500393.html\"><img src=\"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HJ.pAET74XbeQEW0AVpSug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/400c7cbdb84db03e1d71649c9f6a2662\" width=\"130\" height=\"86\" alt=\"Pompeo warns China over interference with U.S. journalists in Hong Kong\" align=\"left\" title=\"Pompeo warns China over interference with U.S. journalists in Hong Kong\" border=\"0\" ></a>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday he believed China had threatened to interfere with the work of U.S. journalists in Hong Kong, and warned Beijing that any decision impinging on Hong Kong\'s autonomy could affect the U.S. assessment of Hong Kong\'s status.  \"These journalists are members of a free press, not propaganda cadres, and their valuable reporting informs Chinese citizens and the world,\" Pompeo said in a statement.<p><br clear=\"all\">','https://news.yahoo.com/pompeo-warns-china-over-interference-202500393.html','Sun, 17 May 2020 16:25:00 -0400','Reuters','https://www.reuters.com/','pompeo-warns-china-over-interference-202500393.html','[{\'height\': \'86\', \'url\': \'http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HJ.pAET74XbeQEW0AVpSug--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/400c7cbdb84db03e1d71649c9f6a2662\', \'width\': \'130\'}]','','us_yahoonews_rss','13:53:42.250324','<div class=\"caas-body\"><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday he believed China had threatened to interfere with the work of U.S. journalists in Hong Kong, and warned Beijing that any decision impinging on Hong Kong\'s autonomy could affect the U.S. assessment of Hong Kong\'s status.</p><p>\"These journalists are members of a free press, not propaganda cadres, and their valuable reporting informs Chinese citizens and the world,\" Pompeo said in a statement.</p><p>Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the territory was promised a \"high degree of autonomy\" for 50 years.

general’s legal reach\" border=\"0\" ></a>Former justice department officials and legal experts have pointed to Barr’s intervention in cases involving Trump associatesLegal experts and and alumnae of the US Department of Justice have begun sounding the alarm about Donald Trump’s attorney general, William Barr.Recently Barr’s justice department withdrew charges against Michael Flynn, the former Trump administration national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal law enforcement officials about his dealings with Russia’s ambassador over sanctions, just before Trump took office.Barr’s decision last week was a stunning reversal and spurred rare rebukes from a large swath of legal experts and former attorneys who worked at the justice department under both Democratic and Republican presidents. And speaking at a fundraiser with thousands of former officials from his administration and previous campaigns, Barack Obama issued a strong warning that the move jeopardized the “rule of law” in the country.Barr’s decision highlighted ongoing anxiety about the lasting impact the current attorney general will have on the position of attorney general and the department of justice overall.On Monday, more than 1,900 former and current justice department officials reiterated their call for Barr to step down for having “once again assaulted the rule of law”.The group that organized the letter collected more than 2,600 signatures for a similar letter in February after the justice department moved to reduce the sentence of Roger Stone, a former Trump administration aide who was convicted in cases that came out of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation. At the time, a number of prosecutors resigned in protest because of the proposed sentencing reductions.“Speaking as somebody who has spent 19 years at the department of justice, the way I have seen William Barr serve as attorney general seems very different to me than the way attorneys general have behaved in the past,” said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney during the Obama administration.She added: “Their job is to be the attorney for the people, to be independent of the White House and instead William Barr has conducted himself in ways that make him seem more like he is a lawyer for Donald Trump.”Trump recently said of Stone “look at the horrible treatment he’s got. He’s going to be OK. He’s going to be OK,” which some federal prosecutors interpreted as a possible precursor to Barr doing more in Stone’s case.The justice department has been a source of frustration for the president.Trump first appointed then-senator Jeff Sessions to the post. Sessions, a longtime US senator from Alabama, was the first member of his chamber to endorse Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Trump often complained that Sessions was not doing enough to “protect him”. Trump eventually became dissatisfied with Sessions, particularly his decision to recuse himself from Mueller’s Russia investigation, and replaced him briefly with Matthew Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, as acting attorney general.Since Barr succeeded Whitaker in February 2019, legal experts have pointed out the close alignment he’s had with Trump. McQuade said Barr has often intervened in cases relating to Trump associates.“Now we’re seeing him interfere in cases that involve close associates of President Trump,” McQuade said. “Certainly as the attorney general he has the authority to do anything he wants in any case. But he doesn’t. He doesn’t meddle in every case, he’s only involved in these cases involving Trump’s associates.”Former justice department officials and legal experts have suggested that Barr is acting more like Trump’s personal attorney rather than the top law enforcement official for the federal government. And since the conclusion of Mueller’s Russia investigation and even since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic Trump has repeatedly ousted or sidelined critics within the federal government.McQuade wondered if Barr, with a sense of confidence from Trump, could try and go after higher-profile political figures in the future. Trump and his allies have vaguely been suggesting that Trump himself was the target of of a vague “Obamagate” scheme.“Just looking a little further down the road, one concern is that William Barr is not done, that not only is he protecting Trump’s friends, that he might use Trump’s justice department not only as a shield but as a sword to go after Trump’s enemies –[Joe] Biden, Jim Comey, Obama, Hillary Clinton,” McQuade said. “Could he use the justice department to go after them?”One former federal prosecutor, who requested anonymity in order to speak more candidly, worried that Barr had “set a precedent” where the “next time DoJ could be used in the same political way”.Meanwhile Elkan Abromowitz, one of the former justice department officials who signed the most recent alumni letter, said that the upcoming presidential election could strongly dictate the future role of the department.If Trump wins, Abromowitz said, Barr will likely keep his role.

And speaking at a fundraiser with thousands of former officials from his administration and previous campaigns, Barack Obama issued a strong warning that the move jeopardized the “rule of law” in the country.Barr’s decision highlighted ongoing anxiety about the lasting impact the current attorney general will have on the position of attorney general and the department of justice overall.On Monday, more than 1,900 former and current justice department officials reiterated their call for Barr to step down for having “once again assaulted the rule of law”.The group that organized the letter collected more than 2,600 signatures for a similar letter in February after the justice department moved to reduce the sentence of Roger Stone, a former Trump administration aide who was convicted in cases that came out of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation. At the time, a number of prosecutors resigned in protest because of the proposed sentencing reductions.“Speaking as somebody who has spent 19 years at the department of justice, the way I have seen William Barr serve as attorney general seems very different to me than the way attorneys general have behaved in the past,” said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney during the Obama administration.She added: “Their job is to be the attorney for the people, to be independent of the White House and instead William Barr has conducted himself in ways that make him seem more like he is a lawyer for Donald Trump.”Trump recently said of Stone “look at the horrible treatment he’s got. He’s going to be OK. He’s going to be OK,” which some federal prosecutors interpreted as a possible precursor to Barr doing more in Stone’s case.The justice department has been a source of frustration for the president.Trump first appointed then-senator Jeff Sessions to the post. Sessions, a longtime US senator from Alabama, was the first member of his chamber to endorse Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Trump often complained that Sessions was not doing enough to “protect him”. Trump eventually became dissatisfied with Sessions, particularly his decision to recuse himself from Mueller’s Russia investigation, and replaced him briefly with Matthew Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, as acting attorney general.Since Barr succeeded Whitaker in February 2019, legal experts have pointed out the close alignment he’s had with Trump. McQuade said Barr has often intervened in cases relating to Trump associates.“Now we’re seeing him interfere in cases that involve close associates of President Trump,” McQuade said. “Certainly as the attorney general he has the authority to do anything he wants in any case. But he doesn’t. He doesn’t meddle in every case, he’s only involved in these cases involving Trump’s associates.”Former justice department officials and legal experts have suggested that Barr is acting more like Trump’s personal attorney rather than the top law enforcement official for the federal government. And since the conclusion of Mueller’s Russia investigation and even since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic Trump has repeatedly ousted or sidelined critics within the federal government.McQuade wondered if Barr, with a sense of confidence from Trump, could try and go after higher-profile political figures in the future. Trump and his allies have vaguely been suggesting that Trump himself was the target of of a vague “Obamagate” scheme.“Just looking a little further down the road, one concern is that William Barr is not done, that not only is he protecting Trump’s friends, that he might use Trump’s justice department not only as a shield but as a sword to go after Trump’s enemies –[Joe] Biden, Jim Comey, Obama, Hillary Clinton,” McQuade said. “Could he use the justice department to go after them?”One former federal prosecutor, who requested anonymity in order to speak more candidly, worried that Barr had “set a precedent” where the “next time DoJ could be used in the same political way”.Meanwhile Elkan Abromowitz, one of the former justice department officials who signed the most recent alumni letter, said that the upcoming presidential election could strongly dictate the future role of the department.If Trump wins, Abromowitz said, Barr will likely keep his role. But if the former Vice President, Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic party nominee, wins, the attorney general and DoJ could undergo significant restructuring.“What I think is going to happen is if Trump loses the election, there’s probably going to be a major push to restructure the justice department out of the cabinet and make it like an independent agency like the Fed or the SEC where the attorney general would be given a 10-year term, pretty much like the FBI,” Abromowitz said.Abromowitz added, “If Trump wins re-election?

In China, local policemen, nurses, security guards, and people [staffing] checking points at metro stations are all using the helmets.\"</p><p>She added that the devices were flexible. \"In many places, they use fixed infrared cameras, but our helmets can be used with higher flexibility, adaptability — it can be worn or put on a tripod.\"</p><p>If a helmet on temperature-scanning mode detects someone nearby with a fever, an alarm goes off.</p><p>\"It gives a warning to the user directly,\" said Dr Guo. </p><h2>There\'s mixed evidence that temperature screening works</h2><p>Experts are skeptical about how helpful temperature scanning will be.</p><p>Professor Davey Jones of Bangor University, who led a research project into the spread of COVID-19, pointed to the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which fumbled its response as the coronavirus spread through the vessel, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:infecting around 700 people and killing eight\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/world/asia/coronavirus-cruise-ship.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">infecting around 700 people and killing eight</a>.</p><p>\"At least 25% of the [ship\'s] population had no symptoms whatsoever, so clearly they\'re not running a temperature,\" he said. \"So you end up missing a huge percentage of these people and they are still shedding the virus.\"</p><p>Professor Jones added that people could be running a temperature for a number of other reasons, such as going through the menopause. \"That leads to a whole bunch of false positives,\" he said.</p><p>Dr Chris Wright, a medical doctor and expert in thermal imaging at the University of Exeter, said temperature scanning could be useful \"if done correctly.\"</p><p>The most precise way of taking someone\'s temperature is via the inner corner of the eye, he said.</p><p>\"The person needs to face the camera squarely because the reading will be affected by angle,\" he told BI via email. \"Also, distance is key. Too close and the reading will be overtly affected by the camera operator, too far away, and sensitivity is lost.\"</p><p>For scanning in clinical settings, Dr Wright added, you need a high-resolution camera. He pointed us to one example he uses, a FLIR device, which has a resolution of 640 x 480. That compares to the smart helmet\'s infrared camera resolution of 384 x 288.</p><p>Such devices, he argued, can be useful at airports, supermarkets,  or even at entrances to doctors\' surgeries, as long as they use a high-resolution camera.</p><p>The idea has been mooted before, Dr Wright said, pointing to <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:airports using thermal scanning during the SARS outbreak\" href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3656-airports-scan-for-sars-victims-flushed-faces/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">airports using thermal scanning during the SARS outbreak</a> in Asia, but there are questions over how effective that was.</p><p>A <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:study published by Eurosurveillance in February\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014668/#r12\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">study published by Eurosurveillance in February</a> concluded: \"Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV [coronavirus] infected travelers to avoid entry of infected travelers.\"</p><p>\"It will identify some high-temperature cases but sensitivity will be poor,\" Dr Wright cautioned.</p><p>There are also questions about who should be wearing these helmets, and what they should do once an alarm is triggered.</p><p>Dr Wright continued: \"Clearly as a policeman, distance is a problem if you need to arrest someone, but never do without wearing a mask and gloves. Is it really up to the police to identify people with a temperature?\"</p><p>While countries such as Singapore and China have deployed everything from robot dogs to drone spies to monitor the population, most citizens in Europe are unused to being tracked in this way.</p><p>Dr Guo argued that some alterations to normal life is to be expected.</p><p>\"I think we may need to make some [short-term] adjustments to our lives, not only to protect ourselves but to protect others\' lives,\" she said. \"[T]his isn\'t one person\'s responsibility, it\'s everybody\'s responsibility.

Because of the lack of public scrutiny of the feature as well as its covert behavior, defense attorneys, forensic experts and civil liberties advocates are concerned that Hide UI could be used without giving owners the due process of law, such as a warrant.</p><p>“This is messed up.

Law enforcement officials can plug any recent model of iPhone into the cables to install an “agent” (a piece of software) on the device. The agent then attempts to crack the passcode, offering an estimate for how much time it might take.</p><p>It can take minutes to crack a four-digit pin and less than a day to crack a six-digit pin, according to <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:calculations by cryptographer Matthew Green\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59jq8a/how-to-make-a-secure-iphone-passcode-6-digits\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">calculations by cryptographer Matthew Green</a>, an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute. For eight- and 10-digit passcodes it can take weeks or years. It is under these circumstances that Hide UI provides a way to get access to the device more quickly.</p><p>“If the standard agent doesn’t work, we can move to Plan B, which is Hide UI,” said one law enforcement professional familiar with the system.</p><p>In order for this feature to work, law enforcement officials must install the covert software and then set up a scenario to put a seized device back into the hands of the suspect, said the people familiar with the system, who did not wish to be identified for fear of violating their NDA with Grayshift and having access to the device revoked.</p><p>For example, a law enforcement official could tell the suspect they can call their lawyer or take some phone numbers off the device. Once the suspect has done this, even if they lock their phone again, Hide UI will have stored the passcode in a text file that can be extracted the next time the phone is plugged into the GrayKey device. Law enforcement can then use the passcode to unlock the phone and extract all the data stored on it.</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:176%;\"><img alt=\"Hide UI installed on an iPhone X, (via NBC News)\" class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vLJX7EMkvY.jecbBz_ugAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTEyMzguNzE0Nzg4NzMyMzk0Mw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BprmRsCfUZ0rqoRcfBTUnQ--~B/aD05OTg7dz01Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/482da68fbab5ca27ea38466c7cb6cba1\" src=\"\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Hide UI installed on an iPhone X, (via NBC News)\" class=\"caas-img\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vLJX7EMkvY.jecbBz_ugAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTEyMzguNzE0Nzg4NzMyMzk0Mw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BprmRsCfUZ0rqoRcfBTUnQ--~B/aD05OTg7dz01Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/482da68fbab5ca27ea38466c7cb6cba1\"/></noscript></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\">Hide UI installed on an iPhone X, (via NBC News)</figcaption></figure><p>“It’s great technology for our cases, but as a citizen I don’t really like how it’s being used.

This was corroborated by one of the law enforcement sources.</p><h2>Legality and secrecy</h2><p>Both of the law enforcement sources that NBC News spoke to said that they would only plug a phone into the GrayKey device if they had a search warrant.</p><p>However, forensic experts working with defense attorneys said they fear that Hide UI may be being used without a warrant by law enforcement officers looking for shortcuts, possibly by arguing “exigent circumstances,” given some of the <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:time restrictions Apple has imposed\" href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/58345/exigent-circumstances-ios-12s-usb-restricted-mode-warrantless-iphone-access/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">time restrictions Apple has imposed </a>around getting data off its phones. NBC News has not independently confirmed that the feature has been used without a warrant.</p><p>It’s not clear how often this feature is used, but hundreds of state and local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. — some of which have been tracked by <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Motherboard\" href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/graykey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Motherboard</a> and <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:Forbes\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/01/15/the-fbi-got-data-from-a-locked-iphone-11-pro-max--so-why-is-it-demanding-apple-unlock-older-phones/#714757df5e65\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes</a> — as well as the FBI, DEA, CBP, Secret Service and other agencies have access to GrayKey devices, according to <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:public records\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/keyword_search/grayshift\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public records</a>.

The feature — and others designed for intelligence gathering — are only explained to potential customers if they sign a non-disclosure agreement, saidthe law enforcement officials.</p><p>NBC News did not find any search warrants that outlined the capabilities of Hide UI, although GrayKey has occasionally been mentioned in court documents, including <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:a search warrant of an iPhone 11 Pro Max\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/01/15/the-fbi-got-data-from-a-locked-iphone-11-pro-max--so-why-is-it-demanding-apple-unlock-older-phones/#600adea05e65\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a search warrant of an iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>, Apple’s latest, most secure phone.</p><p>“Failure to disclose what they are doing in terms that would be understood by the court is a huge problem constitutionally,” said Lance Northcutt, a Chicago-based lawyer and former prosecutor. “That’s assuming there are no abuses going on, which seems ludicrous to me.”</p><p>Some civil liberties groups including the ACLU are concerned that prosecutors could be dropping cases instead of disclosing how the technology works or subjecting it to public scrutiny. This <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:previously happened with stingray devices\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/fbi-would-rather-prosecutors-drop-cases-than-disclose-stingray-details/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previously happened with stingray devices</a>, which spoof a cell tower to intercept phone calls and text messages made by devices nearby.</p><p>Even if a warrant is sought to search the device, it’s not clear whether the subterfuge required to get the passcode from the suspect is being outlined to the prosecutor or judge.</p><p>“Law enforcement use of this ‘agent’ keylogger feature can be legal, so long as the warrant the government gets to search and seize the device spells out that the investigators are permitted to use it,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. “In general, I don\'t think that magistrate judges authorizing search warrants would expect that the government plans to implant malware on a device it has seized.”</p><p>Some of the more specific warrants that might allow for Hide UI to be used include a “sneak and peek” warrant, which allows for the installation of surveillance devices in a suspect’s house, or a Title III warrant <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:typically used for intercepting electronic communications\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-28-electronic-surveillance-title-iii-applications\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">typically used for intercepting electronic communications</a>.</p><p>NBC News asked the Department of Justice if it had any guidelines for the use of GrayKey and Hide UI, <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:similar to those issued for the use of stingrays\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/767321/download\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">similar to those issued for the use of stingrays</a>. Department officials declined to comment, as did the National Sheriffs’ Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.</p><p>Critics believe that the lack of transparency over GrayKey and Hide UI is another example of the <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:increasingly uneven playing field in the world of digital forensics\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/business/law-enforcement-public-defender-technology-gap.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increasingly uneven playing field in the world of digital forensics</a>, where the government has access to flashy tools bound by NDAs or restrictions to use by law enforcement that defense teams can’t access or afford.</p><p>“I’m in a fight with one arm tied behind my back,” said Andrew Garrett, a digital forensics expert. “I’m not getting the same evidence because companies like Grayshift have created NDAs that prohibit law enforcement from being transparent.”</p><p>One GrayKey non-disclosure agreement dating from 2018 and seen by NBC News requires law enforcement to notify Grayshift if details of the technology are likely to be disclosed through the judicial process — for example through a subpoena, summons or order — so that Grayshift has the opportunity to “obtain a protective order or otherwise oppose the disclosure.”</p><p>Northcutt said this was “pretty shocking” because it indicates that the private interests of a third-party vendor could be interfering with due process.</p><p>“You can’t just have law enforcement say, \'we have this magic box, plug your phone in, extract evidence and you have to trust us that this is accurate and that we are giving you all the stuff that’s exculpatory,\'” he said. “Not when the end product will result in the deprivation of people’s liberty.”</p></div>',0,'rss'),(710,'Photos show people dining out, shopping, and getting their hair cut as Texas reports an

(About 25 percent of our respondents say their salaries have been cut.),” Volkov told The Daily Beast. But Putin, like U.S. President Donald Trump, has die-hard fans, and “there is still a big group of people who say there is no alternative [to him].” Putin’s biggest challenge is poverty, that old Russian disease. During his best years, when oil prices were astronomical and revenues were very high indeed, the Russian president was able to provide people with money—and with pride. He was building the armed forces, sending them abroad, overtly or covertly, to Ukraine, Syria, and Africa, and developing very expensive new weapons systems. Putin seemed able to provide, as economists say, both guns and butter. But this year the nation’s rapidly shrinking economy has pushed millions below the poverty line, and Putin—whose approval rating was 80 percent in 2014, has seen his numbers, already in decline, drop precipitously. The current number of 59 percent would be positive in the West, but here in Russia, Putin has been used to nearly complete control over television news coverage, and he’s been losing that grip. The Kremlin&#39;s major newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, claims that 70 percent of people still get their news from Kremlin controlled TV, but 58 percent follow news on the internet as well—or instead of—on state media.So far, dozens of independent news websites have managed to keep functioning, covering news from all angles. But they are under threat, Kirill Kharatyan, editor of Vedomosti, one of Russia&#39;s few independent newspapers, told The Daily Beast. As the Putin government’s popularity declines, he said, concern grows “there will be more pressure on independent newspapers&quot;Where the economy is concerned, the government is quick to point out it has reserves for the state budget, and will meet public sector payrolls. But propping up the economy as a whole is another matter. Last year, even before the pandemic, the Federal State Statistics Service reported 20.9 million Russians, more than 14 percent of the population, living on less than $200 a month.  HUNGER PANGSSmolensk lies about halfway between Moscow and Minsk, in Belarus. It is the poorest region in Russia’s central federal district, and it is in trouble these days. Simply put, unemployed people cannot afford food. From the first weeks of the pandemic shutdowns, Nadezhda Petrusiva and her charity, Mercy, have been overwhelmed with pleas for help from single mothers with several hungry children, people with disabilities, and people who are simply terrified by the pandemic. They call her center asking for food as early as 5 a.m. The center’s volunteers or, as they prefer to call themselves, “people of goodwill,” begin their mornings packing and delivering basic foods—parcels with cereal, flour, bread—for those in trouble. Grandmothers arrive with small pails to pick up their hot meals; homeless people eat at the center’s table. More than 16 percent of the population in Smolensk lives in poverty, trying to survive on less than $5.50 a day. The coronavirus crisis made their situation even more desperate. The Kremlin’s head of the Accounting Chamber, Aleksey Kudrin, predicts that the number of unemployed in Russia as a whole will triple in the coming months. “Never in my eight years of work in charity have I seen so many hungry and desperate people as during these months of coronavirus pandemic,”  says Mercy’s Petrusiva.Putin declared the economic shutdown in late March, after visiting Moscow’s new coronavirus hospital. That was the last time the nation saw the leader in action, dressed in full anti-plague gear, inspecting the so-called “red zone” full of patients with pneumonia. Since then Putin’s key men, including the hospital chief doctor Denis Protsenko, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and the presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov have been diagnosed with coronavirus one after another.  BODY COUNTSRussia’s official death toll has not been nearly as bad as in the United States, Italy, or the United Kingdom, for reasons that are still unclear. District clinics monitor every positive patient at home, possibly providing early care that reduces deaths, but experts say that not all statistics are fully transparent. In April, Moscow’s COVID-19 death toll was 695 people, while the total number of deaths recorded that month was 1,800 higher than usual. “There are people who die from cancer, cardio-vascular disease,  but the autopsy shows that they also had COVID-19; their names are not included in the statistics and that’s where, of course, politics appear here, when governors report to the president, to the federal authorities on the COVID-19 death toll,” Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of Echo of Moscow radio station, told listeners on Saturday. “There will be more dying,&quot; he said. “We are in the middle of the process.”Last Monday Russia saw a huge spike in infections—it is now second only to the United States in total numbers. And Russian authorities seem to have stumbled in protecting medical workers. Nobody, not even the most skillful propagandists, would be able to hide that fact. Due to sloppiness and disorganization, 190 Russian doctors and medics have died from COVID-19, according to a list called “We Remember” compiled by fellow physicians. Last month, Putin promised $300 bonuses for medics working with coronavirus patients and $600 bonuses for doctors treating patients in so-called “red zones;” but when doctors received their salaries for April, the bonuses were missing. Russian medical workers, repeatedly called  “heroes of our times” by state television, are calling for Putin to pay them the promised bonuses. So far 106,762 people have signed their petition.  OPPOSITION OPPORTUNITYPutin’s opponents on both left and right are using this shaky pandemic moment to try to rock Putin’s world. “The power is in agony, their authority is running through their fingers,” says a young communist parliament member, Nikolai Bondarenko. Liberal opposition leader Aleksey Navalny is pressuring the Kremlin online to help poor Russians to stock their empty refrigerators with concrete financial aid in his “Five steps for Russia” program. Might the Kremlin put more pressure on the independent press and the opposition to shut down critics and help Putin’s approval rating?Probably not.“Authorities cannot afford to tighten more bolts now, people already are gritting their teeth,” the founder of Transparency International’s Russian office, Yelena Panfilova, told The Daily Beast. “They might whip a few ministers for a show and maybe put a bit more pressure on the media—they need to look nice for the public.”That’s getting harder and harder for the Putin regime to do.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

(About 25 percent of our respondents say their salaries have been cut.),” Volkov told The Daily Beast. But Putin, like U.S. President Donald Trump, has die-hard fans, and “there is still a big group of people who say there is no alternative [to him].” Putin’s biggest challenge is poverty, that old Russian disease. During his best years, when oil prices were astronomical and revenues were very high indeed, the Russian president was able to provide people with money—and with pride. He was building the armed forces, sending them abroad, overtly or covertly, to Ukraine, Syria, and Africa, and developing very expensive new weapons systems.

The number of deaths among medical personnel increased by one-third in the last week, reaching 149, more than half of them doctors. Medical personnel constitute 11,394 infections, one-fifth of all cases nationwide.</p><p>But Mexico City, with 9 million residents, has been the hardest hit area of the country, and where official death counts have been subject to the greatest questioning.</p><p>The anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption said in a report Monday that it got access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between March 18 and May 12. It showed that in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 death certificates, doctors included the words “SARS,” “COV2,” “COV,” “Covid 19,” or “new coronavirus.”</p><p>The virus\' technical name is SARS-CoV-2. The notes the group counted included terms like “suspected,” \"probable”, or “possible” role of the virus in the deaths. In 3,209 of the certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.</p><p>Only 323 certificates list confirmed coronavirus as a cause of death; 1,045 other death certificates listed COVID-19 but didn\'t specify if it was suspected or confirmed.</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>The group did not say how it accessed the database, which was kept by local courts. But it noted that official counts showed only 1,060 coronavirus deaths during that March 18-May 12 period.</p><p>Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has acknowledged there are more deaths than have officially been reported, and has said a special team of epidemiologists will review the death figures.</p><p>“What we are saying now is that in addition to those with a positive COVID test, are there more? Yes, there are more,” Sheinbaum said Tuesday. “When is that going to be made public? According to Mexican standards this will definitely have to happen and there will be total transparency, but we have to comply with the standards concerning the review of the medical certificates.”</p><p>Mexico performs relatively few tests; only about 150,000 have been carried out so far in a nation of about 125 million people. Federal officials acknowledge some victims have died without being tested and have pledged that cases in which death certificates mention coronavirus as a possible or probable cause of death will eventually be added to official death toll. But they have suggested those “suspected” cases were only about a tenth of test-confirmed deaths.</p><p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has reacted angrily to new reports in the past that claimed Mexico was undercounting its deaths on the federal level, and the annti-corruption group\'s report was unlikely to please him. He has criticized the group the past for allegedly opposing his policies and representing business interests. He has mockingly called it “Mexicans For Corruption.”</p><p>Sheinbaum repeated that mocking term Tuesday and claimed there were efforts to create a split between her administration and the federal government. Both she and López Obrador belong to the Morena party.</p><p>The group\'s founder is Claudio X. Gonzalez, a lawyer, activist and the son of a prominent business magnate.</p></div>',0,'rss'),(724,'For months, Apple said it wouldn&#39;t break into an iPhone for the FBI.

China claims the reincarnate can only be chosen by pulling lots from a golden urn, a method it used to pick its own candidate under the control of the officially atheistic ruling Communist Party.</p><p>Traditionally, the Panchen Lama has served as teacher and aide to the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism’s highest leader who is now 84 and is accused by Beijing of seeking independence for Tibet.

Ebrahim</p><p>KARACHI, May 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The father and brother of two teenage sisters shot dead in Pakistan after mobile phone video of them with a man surfaced online have been arrested, police said on Monday, drawing praise from women\'s rights activists.</p><p>The man who shot the video has also been arrested, while a relative suspected of carrying out the killing is still at large, local district police officer Shafiullah Gandapur said.</p><p>The sisters, who were 16 and 18, were shot dead on Thursday in the remote tribal region of North Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.</p><p>Hundreds of women are killed each year in Pakistan by family members over perceived damage to \"honour\" that can involve eloping, fraternizing with men or any other infraction against conservative values that govern women\'s modesty.</p><p>Many such killings go unreported, but the 2016 death of social media star Qandeel Baloch at the hands of her brother ignited fierce debate over their prevalence and prompted the government to tighten the laws.</p><p>Police have come under mounting pressure to investigate these crimes.</p><p>\"Our intentions are sincere. We first heard about the incident through social media and decided to confirm it,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from North Waziristan.</p><p>\"We reached the crime scene and found traces of blood as well as a blood-stained fabric. We arrested the brother and father of the two girls who were murdered and today successfully arrested Umar Ayaz, who made the video.\"</p><p>Gulalai Ismail, a Pakistani women\'s rights activist exiled in the United States, said the swift action by police in filing a case the day after the murders was a \"win for tribal women\" in the province area.</p><p>\"In such crimes time is of essence,\" she said. \"And if this is delayed, like seven such murders that happened earlier this month, the incident is swiftly swept under the carpet, with many passed off as suicide or natural deaths.\"</p><div class=\"caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse\"><button aria-label=\"\" class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\" title=\"\">Story continues</button></div><p>Human rights experts say enforcement of justice is often lax in cases involving violence against women, with proceedings at times being drawn out while accused killers were freed on bail and cases faded away.</p><p>That is particularly true in remote, socially conservative areas like North Waziristan, where women enjoy little freedom and local customs often hold greater sway than federal laws.</p><p>\"Before 2018, this kind of murder was not considered a crime in the tribal area, neither was it reported,\" she said. Pakistan\'s semi-autonomous tribal areas only came under full federal jurisdiction in 2018.</p><p>Ismail said a tribal leader had urged locals to punish the teenagers featured in the video after it emerged online.</p><p>\"In the tribal code of conduct, this punishment for such acts is always murder,\" she said.</p><p>The whereabouts of a third girl who also appeared in the video are unknown, Ismail said, adding: \"She needs protection too.\" (Reporting by Zofeen T.

帕里斯提出要求后增加了投票地点。尽管他认为在新型冠状病毒肺炎大流行期间亲自投票很危险,帕里斯告诉《卫报》，他在意识到附近的一个城市有两个投票地点后提出了这个请求，而他的城市没有。虽然他相信选举可以被操纵，并理解为什么它可能会出现在特朗普面前，但他说增加投票地点不是民主党的权力攫取。&ldquo;我必须接受指责。我打电话给他们，说我想要一个投票中心，所以他们给了我，”他说。加州的指控强调了总统如何利用投票程序迅速变化的方式来应对新型冠状病毒肺炎，并质疑 11月选举结果的合法性。特朗普长期抱怨，但没有证据,选举受到选民欺诈的影响，在这一流行病中，对邮寄投票的日益关注可能会为他提供一条新的线索，以削弱对今年选举的信心。几项研究表明，选民欺诈不是一个普遍的问题。加州大学选举法教授理查德 &middot; 哈森说: &ldquo;鉴于总统多年来一直在发表未经证实的选民欺诈言论，我预计这些言论将会继续下去。”。欧文。&ldquo;这些评论非常令人担忧，因为它们增加了总统的支持者不接受选举结果的可能性，如果他在 11月失败的话。” 哈森和其他专家上个月帮助撰写了一份报告，就如何增强对 2020 选举结果的信心提供指导。这些建议包括让各州提前制定紧急应急计划，并教育公众，由于官员计票邮寄，选举结果可能无法在选举之夜公布。民主党人和共和党人已经在为 11月扩大邮寄投票的力度而争吵,但是关于能否进行面对面投票的争论可能仍然是一个爆炸性的问题。面对投票工作人员短缺和对面对面集会的担忧，选举官员严重削减了面对面投票。政党和运动可能会积极争夺哪些投票站关闭，新的投票站放在哪里。&ldquo;所有这些变化都允许那些坦率地想破坏我们对选举制度的信心的人说 \'看看他们对你做了什么\'。这是一个腐败的体制，\'杰西卡莱文森教授洛约拉法学院在洛杉矶.&ldquo;当然，每当我们投票方式发生变化时，我认为这可能会让人们感到不安，他们可能会质疑自己是否能对这个体系有信心,特朗普总统抓住了这个机会。\"<p><br clear=\"all\">','','ali','21:39:55.079242','<div class=\"caas-body\"><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-img-container noheight\"><img alt=\"&lt;span&gt;Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;\" class=\"caas-img has-preview\" data-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zCc2vCtRvXuOcLT7mbEpiQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/1806c1dfbf8aa2b2851af4a3c6e7b4d7\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zCc2vCtRvXuOcLT7mbEpiQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/1806c1dfbf8aa2b2851af4a3c6e7b4d7\"/></div><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\"><span>照片: 马克 &middot;
