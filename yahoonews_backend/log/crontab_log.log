Faces and fists pounded the windows of Ohio’s capitol like a zombie apocalypse. In Michigan, an armed crowd stormed the state house. Then, history repeated itself.Taking a page from his Charlottesville playbook, Donald Trump called the protesters “good people” and urged Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, to “make a deal” over the shutdown. The president tweeted that Whitmer should “give a little, and put out the fire”. In other words, negotiate over the barrel of a gun. After all, his base was “angry”.One state over, in Illinois, an anti-shutdown protester waived a poster aimed at the state’s Jewish governor, JB Pritzker: “Arbeit macht frei, JB.” The words that hung over the gates of Auschwitz.A Trump administration insider conveyed that it was all a “bit” reminiscent of the “late” Weimar Republic.

Hell became part of the here and now.Election day is six months away. The US may experience 25% unemployment and economic collapse.

Echoing his boss, Larry Kudlow ties himself into knots over earlier pronouncements that the scourge would be quickly gone. Marc Short, Mike Pence’s chief of staff, prematurely rejects projections of a death toll above 60,000. By Tuesday, the total will probably exceed 70,000.How this plays out at the ballot box remains to be seen. But the early numbers should give Trump serious pause. It is unlikely that racial minorities, suburban mothers and college degree holders will take kindly to bully boys playing Trump surrogates.A poll taken last month showed most Americans wary of returning to normal, with those living in cities and suburbs signaling particular reluctance. Indeed, Republicans disfavored such a move by nearly a two-to-one margin.As for the presidential horserace, Trump is lagging Joe Biden in most national polls and in the swing states. Among college graduates, the former vice-president holds a near 20-point lead. Biden is ahead by double digits among women. Cultural resentments are two-way streets.All this is a continuation of trends that appeared in the 2018 midterms. Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House and Democrats captured the female vote by nearly three-to-two, suburban women by more than 20 points, and a majority of white college graduates. Peloton moms made a difference.More ominously for the president, swing states are drifting away: Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are lining up for Biden. In a break from four years ago, seniors are growing tired of Trump. Were the trend to hold, the ballgame would be over.Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio also appear shaky. Biden could be sitting atop an electoral college landslide.Excluding New York state, the number of coronavirus cases have moved upward and the average number of fatalities appears stuck in neutral. This is not the re-election campaign Trump envisioned in January. Not surprisingly, some of his most ardent supporters in the Senate are engaging in political social distancing.Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, North Carolina’s Thom Tillis and Arizona’s Martha McSally tout home-state accomplishments. They are not embracing Trump. The impeachment vote feels a century ago.McSally appears destined for defeat and Tillis is in a dead heat. Only McConnell is given a clear edge and even he is struggling.Coronavirus has unleashed more than death. Social fissures once buried have metastasized into jagged volcanic chasms.

The Prime Minister is expected to unveil the Government’s “roadmap” out of the coronavirus lockdown in an address to the nation next Sunday, after ministers take stock of a study showing the rate of the virus’s transmission in the UK. One of the plans being discussed to help to reopen workplaces across the country is to ask companies to routinely test asymptomatic staff as part of a national effort to track the disease and isolate those who could be infectious. Based on the current, reduced infection rate, Mr Johnson is hoping to put teachers on three weeks’ notice to reopen primary schools in England to all pupils on June 1, Whitehall sources said. Year 10 and Year 12 pupils are then expected to form the first wave of secondary pupils returning to school at a later point, if such a move would be unlikely to increase the transmission rate over the threshold that Mr Johnson warned could result in a dangerous second peak. The earliest possible return of primary schoolchildren is intended to minimise the threat to “early years development” and help parents to return to work.

You know, the numbers are heading in the right direction,” Trump said, in response to a question about workers at meat processing plants being forced back on the job despite fears of spreading the virus. “It’s all working out. It’s all working out. It’s horrible that we have to go through it, but it’s all working out.”The town hall—billed by Fox News as “America Together: Returning to Work” and broadcast live from the memorial built to honor a president who, earlier this weekend, Trump said did less for black people than he has—was in many ways a highlight reel of the president’s inadequate response to a pandemic that has claimed more than 68,000 lives, including a record 2,909 just on Thursday.The president casually announced that the final death toll could reach 100,000 people, more than 50 percent higher than he told Americans only a few weeks ago. He made scientifically dubious claims about the speed and availability of a potential vaccine—throwing in a vow to “be AIDS-free within eight years.” And he saved his most emotional answer for a question from a New Jersey guidance counselor who asked him to “please let go of those behaviors” and “characteristics that do not serve you” when dealing with the press.Trump’s response to that request, as best as it can be distilled, included a rambling list of supposed accomplishments unrelated to the pandemic, including increased military spending and the formation of the “Space Force,” as well as the assertion that not even Lincoln ever faced such mistreatment while in office.“I am greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen. The closest would be that gentleman right up there,” Trump said, nodding at Daniel Chester French’s statue of the 16th president in the temple where, as Royal Cortissoz’s epitaph states, “the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever.”“They always said Lincoln, nobody got treated worse than Lincoln,” Trump said. “I believe I am treated worse.”In the days since Trump meanderingly suggested that Americans might be able to cure themselves of COVID-19 by injecting either sunlight or disinfectant into their bodies, the White House has attempted to shift the focus of its coronavirus response from public health to an economic message.But as question after question came in from across the country about the specifics of Trump’s response to a pandemic that has effectively shuttered the national economy, Trump primarily responded with boasts about past accomplishments, mini-tirades about past grievances, or generalities about how the nation will “win bigger than we’ve ever won before” once the crisis abates.“You’re gonna get a job where you’re gonna get more money, frankly,” Trump told a single mom in Alabama who said she was facing eviction and struggled to pay even the smallest bills. “I’ve got a great feel for this stuff.”“I want ’em to go back, yeah, I want to get our country back,” Trump said, in response to a pair of questions from a teacher and student about his plan to reopen the nation’s schools. “We have to go back. We have to go back. And, whatever it is.”“It depends on where you’re coming from,” Trump told a D.C. restaurateur who asked about specific protocols to keep restaurants safe. “It goes up and it goes up rapidly,” he added of the death toll, but sunnily explained that the nation’s dead are “at the very lower end of the plane.”Every desired answer, from a timeline for opening restaurants at full capacity to filling sports stadiums and college graduations, was predicated on Trump’s enthusiastic prediction that “we are going to have a vaccine by the end of this year.”“The doctors would say, ‘Well, you shouldn’t say that.’ I’ll say what I think,” Trump said, doubling down on a vaccine development schedule that would surpass even the most hysterically optimistic timelines put forward by epidemiologists for the rollout of a potential vaccine. “I think we’re going to have a vaccine much sooner than later… Look, a vaccine has never gone like it’s gone now.”At one point, Trump marveled at the changes in everyday life as a result of the pandemic, noting the yawning distance between himself and Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. But that distance, while effective at halting the spread of the deadly coronavirus, did little to stop the spread of another pandemic: what World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called “an infodemic.”“We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic,” Ghebreyesus told the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15, the same day as Trump’s third-to-last all-day visit to one of his golf clubs. “Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

But it is most dangerous for the European honeybee, which is defenseless in the face of the hornet’s spiky mandibles, long stinger and potent venom.Washington state verified four reports of Asian giant hornets in two north-western cities in December. The species becomes more active in April, prompting local officials to invite the public to help beekeepers by creating their own hornet traps.“It’s a shockingly large hornet,” Todd Murray, Washington State University Extension entomologist and invasive species specialist, said in a statement. “It’s a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees.”Murray said it was important for people to learn to recognize the insect now, while the population is small and still new to the region.“We need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small,” he said, “so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.”The hornets are about the size of an adult thumb, with a yellow and orange head. They are most destructive in the late summer and early fall. One telltale sign they have visited a hive is the remains of decapitated bees.Some researchers refer to the insect as a “murder hornet”, according to a New York Times story published on Saturday.In Japan, up to 50 people a year die after being stung, though the hornet is usually only aggressive to humans if it is disturbed.The Times story prompted a slew of comments on social media, noting the appearance of the hornets in the US in 2020, alongside famine, pestilence and war.“Whomever had murder by hornet on their apocalypse bingo card, please step forward to collect your winnings,” wrote Kaz Weida, a freelance journalist.The comedian Patton Oswalt shared the story and wrote “murder hornets. Sure thing, 2020. Give us everything. Hypno-frogs. Fecal blizzards. Toilet tsunamis. A CATS sequel.

The species becomes more active in April, prompting local officials to invite the public to help beekeepers by creating their own hornet traps.“It’s a shockingly large hornet,” Todd Murray, Washington State University Extension entomologist and invasive species specialist, said in a statement. “It’s a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees.”Murray said it was important for people to learn to recognize the insect now, while the population is small and still new to the region.“We need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small,” he said, “so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.”The hornets are about the size of an adult thumb, with a yellow and orange head. They are most destructive in the late summer and early fall. One telltale sign they have visited a hive is the remains of decapitated bees.Some researchers refer to the insect as a “murder hornet”, according to a New York Times story published on Saturday.In Japan, up to 50 people a year die after being stung, though the hornet is usually only aggressive to humans if it is disturbed.The Times story prompted a slew of comments on social media, noting the appearance of the hornets in the US in 2020, alongside famine, pestilence and war.“Whomever had murder by hornet on their apocalypse bingo card, please step forward to collect your winnings,” wrote Kaz Weida, a freelance journalist.The comedian Patton Oswalt shared the story and wrote “murder hornets. Sure thing, 2020. Give us everything. Hypno-frogs. Fecal blizzards. Toilet tsunamis. A CATS sequel. We can take it.”The author Rabih Alameddine posted: “I really think that was missing from my life this year was murder hornets.”<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/murder-hornets-washington-state-threaten-200206648.html', 'pub_date': 'Sat, 02 May 2020 16:02:06 -0400', 'source': 'https://www.theguardian.com/international', 'source_url': 'The Guardian', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/87cmpUYq6ZKuI1yj_2O8Zw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/68efe737c5eb0ad8ae06493896e80bbc', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

Fred Upton, a moderate Republican running for his 18th term in office, posts a coronavirus dispatch for his constituents, highlighting his own efforts to respond to the crisis and the news from Washington, often with cameos from Democrats.Absent from his Facebook updates are any mentions of President Donald Trump, whose response to the pandemic has raised questions that threaten to drag down Republicans&#39; electoral prospects this fall, or of the president&#39;s provocative news briefings, which have become a forum for partisan attacks on Democrats and dubious claims about the virus.&quot;You have to sort of thread the needle,&quot; Upton said in an interview, explaining how he has tried to navigate Trump&#39;s performance during the crisis. &quot;I&#39;ve been careful. I said, &#39;Let&#39;s look to the future,&#39; versus, &#39;Why didn&#39;t we do this a few months ago?&#39; I&#39;m not interested in pointing the finger of blame. I want to correct the issues.&quot;It is a tricky task for lawmakers like Upton in centrist districts throughout the country, who understand that their reelection prospects -- and any hope their party might have of taking back the House of Representatives -- could rise or fall based on how they address the pandemic. Already considered a politically endangered species before the novel coronavirus began ravaging the United States, these moderates are now working to counter the risk that their electoral fates could become tied to Trump&#39;s response at a time when the independent voters whose support they need are increasingly unhappy with his performance.The president&#39;s combative news conferences, which his own political advisers have counseled him to curtail, have made the challenge all the steeper.&quot;It does make it difficult at times,&quot; Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., said. He said he hoped his constituents would evaluate him not based on Trump&#39;s record but on his own.&quot;I&#39;m hanging on -- not hanging on, flourishing -- in a district I should probably not have as a Republican,&quot; said Katko, one of only two House Republicans running for reelection in a district Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Voters &quot;are going to judge me on what I did or did not do, and that&#39;s all I can ask.&quot;In an attempt to ensure their contests become referendums on their own responses to the virus rather than the president&#39;s, vulnerable House Republicans are instead brandishing their own independent streaks, playing up their work with Democrats, doubling down on constituent service and hosting town-hall-style events -- avoiding mention of Trump whenever possible.It is an approach that looks familiar to former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., who tried to distance himself from Trump on immigration and other issues in 2018 as he fought to hang onto his seat in a diverse South Florida district but was swept out in a midterm debacle that handed Democrats control of the House.&quot;The president continues to be reckless in the context of the COVID-19 crisis,&quot; Curbelo said. &quot;You could see a similar dynamic where a lot of Republicans in competitive districts will just break with him in an effort to protect their own candidacies.&quot;Many of his former colleagues in competitive districts had hoped the severity of the crisis would give them a platform to highlight their own responses, Curbelo said. But as Trump&#39;s nightly briefings &quot;became more about the president and his personality&quot; than about the disease, he added, &quot;Republicans have perceived a peril in that development, and certainly some of the recent polling validates that.&quot;Moderate Republicans are doing what they can to shift the dynamic. In virtual town-hall-style meetings conducted by telephone from his central New York district, Katko has stressed the importance of bipartisanship, saying his constituents are &quot;sick of the nastiness&quot; in Washington.Katko teamed up recently with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, for one such call, in which he broke with one of his own party&#39;s leaders, rejecting a proposal by the top Senate Republican to allow states to go bankrupt rather than provide a federal lifeline.&quot;I&#39;m going to continue to work across the aisle,&quot; Katko told voters, pointing to his relationship with Gillibrand. &quot;I totally disagree with what Mitch McConnell said -- that&#39;s a great example.&quot;In southeastern Pennsylvania, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, another Republican whose heavily suburban district went to Clinton in 2016, has been doing his best to avoid answering for Trump&#39;s comments as well.Asked by local reporters about the president&#39;s early remarks minimizing the coronavirus and comparing it to the flu, Fitzpatrick demurred.&quot;You&#39;ll have to ask him why he made those comments,&quot; Fitzpatrick said. &quot;I really do believe that everybody&#39;s doing their best right now.&quot;And calling in to a radio show in Michigan, Upton hedged when asked if he agreed with the president&#39;s optimism about reopening the economy. &quot;As much as the president wants to open things up -- and we all do -- I think you&#39;re going to have to let the virus really determine where things are at the end of the day,&quot; he said. &quot;We know that we are not there yet.&quot;In some ways, the dilemma these centrist Republicans are facing is the same one they have had to navigate since Trump was elected as they have repeatedly been called upon to answer for his more provocative statements and actions. But the pandemic has sharply raised the stakes as their constituents bear the brunt of its dire consequences.At home in their districts, lawmakers have largely been able to avoid direct questions about the president&#39;s handling of the crisis, instead fielding an onslaught of requests from constituents and reporters for basic information about when relief will reach them.&quot;People are going to make a judgment here: Who do they want to give the responsibility of governing to, given what has just occurred?&quot; said David Winston, a Republican pollster who works with the House Republican Conference. &quot;Did you try to do the right thing? People want to know how their elected representatives are trying to solve this.&quot;That has translated into a new raft of bipartisan legislation from moderate lawmakers up for reelection intended to confront the pandemic. In announcing a bill he introduced with Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., to create a Sept. 11-style commission to examine the government&#39;s response to the virus after the pandemic subsides, Katko sought to assure voters it was apolitical.&quot;I just honestly think that this may be an opportunity, this COVID crisis, to show people that bipartisanship works,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re going to be struggling for a while. And I think as we struggle as a country, the last thing people want to hear is partisan crap.&quot;Katko&#39;s bill would delay the formation of the review commission until 2021, meaning it would not begin investigating until after the election.After Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would create a special committee to scrutinize the Trump administration&#39;s response, Fitzpatrick, who faces a primary challenge from the right, criticized the move as inappropriate, calling for unity.&quot;We all remember 9/11 and how incredibly united our country was,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody was questioning anybody else&#39;s decisions. There was a time and a place to do that down the road.&quot;From his porch in St. Joseph, Michigan, Upton unveiled a plan that aims to modernize the nation&#39;s health care system to prepare for future pandemics. His nightly Facebook dispatches have drawn responses that offer a glimpse of the political balance he is struggling to strike.&quot;Not giving the President Trump administration any credit are you Fred,&quot; Jerry Litke commented on a recent post that omitted any mention of Trump.But Patricia Resetar had a complaint of her own about the same dispatch, demanding that Upton answer for the administration&#39;s failure to deploy broad testing throughout the country.&quot;Where is all the testing?&quot; she wrote. &quot;Where is it, and why aren&#39;t you holding this administration accountable?&quot;Upton said in an interview that he was &quot;not afraid to give the president credit on a variety of issues&quot; or to &quot;be against him when I think he&#39;s wrong.&quot; In his purple district, which went for President Barack Obama in 2012 but Trump in 2016, voters &quot;don&#39;t always identify as Republican or Democrat; they want you to do your job,&quot; he said. &quot;If people voted straight party line, I would have lost in the &#39;90s.&quot;Just outside Syracuse, New York, Gary Dixon, a retired salesman who supports Katko, said he appreciated that the congressman was &quot;staying in his lane&quot; in responding to the pandemic. Although he voted for Trump in 2016 and said he was most likely to support him in November over former Vice President Joe Biden, Dixon also said he worried that an association with the president had the potential to damage other Republican candidates.&quot;It&#39;s a tightrope,&quot; he said of the challenge that Katko and his fellow moderates face. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be on that wire where you&#39;re trying to stay in the middle, but I don&#39;t think his middle position will alienate the true Republicans.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/fearing-political-peril-republicans-edge-174010549.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xKux6Zm3eV0xtd6kFbVkBg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/15de0b4b53280f5fced422fd547c29cd" width="130" height="86" alt="Fearing Political Peril, Republicans Edge Away From Trump on Pandemic Response" align="left" title="Fearing Political Peril, Republicans Edge Away From Trump on Pandemic Response" border="0" ></a>WASHINGTON -- Every evening from his kitchen table in southwestern Michigan, Rep.

With festivals and fairs cancelled, the beachy state is bracing for an economic hitThe Maine Lobster festival is not for the faint of heart. Tens of thousands of people travel to Rockland, Maine – a town of about 7,000 full-time residents along the southern coast of the state – to attend the salty affair every year. The event, immortalized by David Foster Wallace in Consider the Lobster, features carnival rides, cooking competitions, a Sea Goddess beauty pageant and, of course, a lot of lobster.No Sea Goddess will be crowned this year. With the Covid-19 crisis rapidly spreading throughout tNew England, the festival has been cancelled. While the lobsters have been spared for another year, the communities that rally around the seasonal event are bracing for a hard hit.Many parts of Maine, which dubs itself “Vacationland”, rely on the millions of tourists that flock to its beach towns and sandy shores during the summer. The state had over 37 million out-of-state visitors in 2019, who spent a total of $6.5bn. There is some skiing in winter but three-quarters of visitors who spent at least a day and a night in the state visited during May and September.This summer will look a lot different and not just because the Lobster festival has been cancelled.While Maine has seen a little over 1,000 positive Covid-19 cases and 52 deaths out of its population of over 1m – a relatively small number compared to other states in the US northeast region – the state is taking precautionary measures to keep its numbers low.On Thursday, the Maine governor Janet Mills announced an extension of the state-wide stay-at-home orders until 31 May. For the rest of the month, any visitors to the state will be asked to quarantine for 14 days, Mills said. Many of the state’s tourist-oriented businesses such as hotels and campgrounds will be allowed to open 1 July, according to the state’s most recent plan to reopen the economy.“As other states experience devastating outbreaks, we cannot let our guards down,” Mills said at a press conference.A shorter summer tourist season – or, if stay-at-home orders continue through the summer, no season at all – will mean devastating effects for much of the state’s economy that relies on summer’s visitors to keep communities afloat.Maria Irrera who has a holiday rental close to her home in the idyllic seaside village of Lincolnville Beach, a short drive from Rockland, has already had to cancel three summer bookings.Lincolnville Beach has one of the few sandy beaches along midcoast Maine. During the summer, holidaymakers can dine out at McLaughlin’s Lobster Shack or down oysters and cocktails at the Wheel House Beach Bar, housed in the converted wheelhouse of an old sardine carrier boat.“If I look out the window at the beautiful bay, and if I hadn’t read the news, I wouldn’t know there was anything wrong,” said Irrera.Airbnb had asked renters to cancel bookings until May and while Maine has been less affected by coronavirus and is now beginning the process of opening back up, Irrera is worried about making future reservations and the impact of the shutdown on her community.“I’m OK. I can work from home. But the hotels? They don’t know what’s going on,” she said. “Everyone’s losing so much money.”The travel industry in the US as a whole is feeling the severe effects of stay-at-home orders. The US Travel Association estimates that the industry has lost $99bn since shutdowns started at the beginning of March.Even if states begin to relax their stay-at-home orders, it is unclear what travel will look like before a vaccine is created, which could take up to 18 months to roll out. While there are many people who are eager to leave the homes they have been quarantining for a nice vacation on the beach, there are also many who are worried about what traveling could mean for contracting or further spreading the virus.The US travel industry is closely watching China, where reports of infection have dropped dramatically over the last weeks, but demand for flights is at about 45% of what it was before the crisis, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Most of the flights can be attributed to people going back to work and to visit friends and family; the tourism market in the country has not seen as much of a resurgence.The situation looks even more stark for the US, where there has been no increase in demand for air travel – despite the number of infections decreasing – because of health concerns and an overall downturn in the economy.“The [aviation] industry is in freefall and we have not hit rock bottom,” said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata’s CEO, in a statement.While the airline industry’s numbers may be a canary in the coal mine for how the rest of the travel industry is doing, Maine and the rest of New England are holding on to hope that the economy will reopen by the peak of the season, in late June.In Massachusetts, communities on the southwestern coast have already seen cancellations or the postponing of major summer events such as county fairs, food and wine festivals and annual concerts.In Nantucket, the former whaling island that is the summer home of some of the US’s wealthiest people, local shops, museums and restaurants are all closed down right as they are supposed to be kicking into gear. The annual Daffodil festival, an event that usually provides an early kick-off to the start of the season, was cancelled as stay-at-home orders continue until 18 May.“If this lingers on into the summer, that will severely impact tourism. In Nantucket, it’s basically the primary income source,” said William DeSousa-Mauk, spokesperson for the Nantucket Chamber of Commerce. “Our economy would collapse.”Mark Snyder, owner of The Nantucket Hotel and the Winnetu Oceanside Resort on Martha’s Vineyard, said he has not had to layoff any of his employees, even though his hotel on Nantucket is open only for essential travel and resort on Martha’s Vineyard is closed completely.“We need to be open late and June and on, otherwise we will have problems,” Snyder said. “If we couldn’t open this summer, that would be painful.”But money isn’t everything.Compared to Maine, Massachusetts is a coronavirus hotspot: the state of nearly 7 million people has had more than 62,200 cases of coronavirus and 3,500 deaths, many concentrated in Boston.Nantucket and its neighbor island, the even more posh Martha’s Vineyard, have been successful in keeping the virus off their shores, having about 30 positive cases altogether out of its populations of 11,000 and 16,000, respectively. Both islands, and Maine, are popular with New Yorkers, the state that has the most coronavirus cases in the country.Reopening would have to be a balancing act that prioritizes keeping local residents healthy while making sure tourists can come in to fuel the local economy. “There’s really no other industry,” DeSousa-Mauk said.<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/only-industry-pandemic-restrictions-threaten-050043502.html"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N0_NR28JyX2pUe4_KGivJw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f0b6366f024fe64ae9eeedaafe8ce9b5" width="130" height="86" alt="‘It’s our only industry’: pandemic restrictions threaten Maine’s tourist season" align="left" title="‘It’s our only industry’: pandemic restrictions threaten Maine’s tourist season" border="0" ></a>Out-of-state visitors spent a total of $6.5bn in 2019.

But as food supplies dwindle, many in Texas are being turned away and experts and community workers say that the food crisis is hitting the state’s large immigrant population especially hard.The TDEM documents are from its most recent state situation report and show food banks in the state are seeing an 88% increase in the number of people showing up to food distribution centers, but sector representatives say that even those figures may understate the surge.Celia Cole is CEO of Feeding Texas, an association of the state’s food banks. Cole said: “We’re seeing now close to a 100% increase in the number of people seeking out help compared to last year. That means that there’s double the need there was a year ago.”But these numbers only represent the people that food banks are actually able to supply.TDEM’s situation report adds: “In the last two weeks, Texas food banks report having to turn people away at approximately 30% of their distributions”.Cole said that early in the crisis, Texas food banks “would take food to a distribution that might normally have 100 families, take enough food for 200 families and then 800 families would show up”.As a result, Cole said, food banks in the state are depleting their supplies quickly. “If I look at our five largest food banks, which is where the greatest volume is going out, they’re reporting on average they’re going to run out of food in a couple of weeks. That’s scary. Those food banks are where you’re seeing the lines of a thousand people show up,” she said.In addition, as demand soars, the normal source of donations, surplus from grocery stores, has dried up.According to the situation report, Texas food banks are reporting a 13% decrease in monetary donations and a 39% decrease in food donations. And a relatively older volunteer workforce in partner agencies such as churches, which usually handle distribution of food packages, is sheltering in place to avoid contracting Covid-19.“This is by far the biggest crisis we’ve ever faced and the greatest need we’ve ever seen across our network,” Cole said.While the Trump administration recently announced a Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), in which the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will buy meat and produce to be distributed to food banks, Cole says that it will not come quickly enough to solve food banks’ immediate problems.“USDA has struggled to procure this food and we don’t expect them to arrive at our food banks until July,” she said.In an email, a USDA spokesperson said: “USDA is working as quickly as possible to implement CFAP.”Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of several books on food systems and food security, said the crisis in Texas had hit a state that already struggled with poverty and food insecurity.He said that in 2015, a survey by himself and his colleagues “found that 25% of people in Austin, Texas, which is not a poor city, were food insecure.”Patel added that Texas’s deteriorating food security has been exacerbated by the hard line immigration policies of the Trump administration. “People are worried about Ice raids,” Patel said.In Austin, he said: “As soon as a rumor circulated that Ice was staking out food banks and supermarkets in Latinx neighborhoods that undocumented people might go to, all of a sudden, Latinx people wouldn’t go there and someone had to become the designated shopper for a bunch of families.”Carmen Llanos Pulido is a community organizer and the Executive Director of Go Austin/Vamos!

But as food supplies dwindle, many in Texas are being turned away and experts and community workers say that the food crisis is hitting the state’s large immigrant population especially hard.The TDEM documents are from its most recent state situation report and show food banks in the state are seeing an 88% increase in the number of people showing up to food distribution centers, but sector representatives say that even those figures may understate the surge.Celia Cole is CEO of Feeding Texas, an association of the state’s food banks. Cole said: “We’re seeing now close to a 100% increase in the number of people seeking out help compared to last year. That means that there’s double the need there was a year ago.”But these numbers only represent the people that food banks are actually able to supply.TDEM’s situation report adds: “In the last two weeks, Texas food banks report having to turn people away at approximately 30% of their distributions”.Cole said that early in the crisis, Texas food banks “would take food to a distribution that might normally have 100 families, take enough food for 200 families and then 800 families would show up”.As a result, Cole said, food banks in the state are depleting their supplies quickly. “If I look at our five largest food banks, which is where the greatest volume is going out, they’re reporting on average they’re going to run out of food in a couple of weeks.

He had previously said the US was looking into the possibility the virus came from a lab in Wuhan, China.On Sunday, Pompeo said: “There is enormous evidence that that’s where this began”, later adding: “I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”At one point, the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident.“Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,” he said.But when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite – that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified – Pompeo replied: “That’s right. I agree with that.”Donald Trump made a similar unsupported claim on Thursday, saying he was privy to evidence of the pandemic began in a Chinese lab but was not permitted to share it.By Sunday afternoon, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the US had confirmed 1,134,507 coronavirus cases and more than 66,000 deaths. Worldwide, there have been nearly 3.5m cases confirmed and more than 245,000 people have died.Beset by criticism of its response to the outbreak and management of the ensuing public health crisis, the Trump administration has sought to focus blame on China.Most epidemiologists say that while it is possible the outbreak started in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronaviruses have been intensively studied, it is a far less likely scenario than the theory that it was transmitted naturally from bats through an intermediary animal, mutating along the way to become dangerous to humans.On Tuesday, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said “the weight of evidence” pointed to natural transmission but was not conclusive.Beijing has rejected the suggestion the virus could have escaped from a laboratory. But Chinese authorities have not allowed foreign experts, including investigators from the World Health Organization, to take part in the investigation into the origins of the virus. Nor have they shared samples taken from wild animals at the Wuhan livestock market where they claim the outbreak began.In 2018, US diplomats and scientists raised concerns in state department cables about safety standards and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in medical journal the Lancet found that 27 had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. The same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not.Pompeo has a patchy record on characterising US intelligence estimates.He repeatedly claimed there was no direct evidence linking Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to the murder of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, contradicting substantial US evidence implicating him.He also repeatedly claimed there was evidence of an “imminent threat” to US embassies posed by Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who the US killed in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January.A formal letter justifying the strike sent by the White House to Congress in February made no mention of an imminent threat.<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/mike-pompeo-enormous-evidence-coronavirus-190807041.html"><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2TQPvgmgUdV_sPUJEMoGxQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/28cd06f978078359cbc7c43920f48ece" width="130" height="86" alt="Mike Pompeo: &#39;enormous evidence&#39; coronavirus came from Chinese lab" align="left" title="Mike Pompeo: &#39;enormous evidence&#39; coronavirus came from Chinese lab" border="0" ></a>* Secretary of state does not provide any evidence to back claim * Trump aide unclear on whether claim is virus was man-made * Coronavirus US: latest news * Coronavirus outbreak: full coverageSecretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed on Sunday there is “enormous evidence” the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory – but did not provide any of the alleged evidence.Pompeo’s claims, made in an interview with ABC’s This Week, represented an escalation in rhetoric.

Wallace then shifted his attention to numerous states allowing hair salons and spas to open back up, asking whether it was currently safe if customers and workers are both wearing masks.“It’s safer, but we’ve made it clear that that is not a good Phase One activity and I think the president has made that clear when he discussed the case in Georgia,” Birx reacted, referencing President Donald Trump’s winking criticism of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s reopen plans.“Let me ask about one more activity,” Wallace pivoted. “Big crowds of protesters that went into the Michigan state capitol without masks, massing together in close quarters. I’m not asking you about the First Amendment right to protest that of course they have, but from a public health standpoint, is that safe?”“It’s devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and they infect their grandmother or grandfather who has a comorbid condition and they have a serious or very unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of their lives,” Birx said. “So we need to protect each other at the same time as we’re voicing our discontent.”Last week, hundreds of angry anti-lockdown demonstrators—some of them armed—crowded inside the Michigan State House without adhering to social distancing guidelines or wearing masks, demanding that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer immediately open the state’s businesses back up.The president, meanwhile, stood up for the protesters, describing them as “very good people” while calling on Whitmer to “see them, talk to them, make a deal.”Many pro-Trump commentators have recently begun to push back against mask-wearing, claiming it is largely an instrument of government oppression and a plot to scare the American people. “The masks, they’re kind of a constant reminder,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham said last week. “You see the mask and you think you’re not safe, you are not back to normal—not even close.” Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Gretchen Whitmer immediately open the state’s businesses back up.The president, meanwhile, stood up for the protesters, describing them as “very good people” while calling on Whitmer to “see them, talk to them, make a deal.”Many pro-Trump commentators have recently begun to push back against mask-wearing, claiming it is largely an instrument of government oppression and a plot to scare the American people. “The masks, they’re kind of a constant reminder,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham said last week. “You see the mask and you think you’re not safe, you are not back to normal—not even close.” Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

There were no reports of fighting in the capital, Caracas.But earlier on Sunday Venezuela’s leaders claimed they had frustrated what they called a US-backed assault near the port city of La Guaira, 20 miles north of Caracas, killing eight alleged assailants.Venezuela’s interior minister, Néstor Reverol, claimed a platoon of “terrorist mercenaries” had tried to make landfall using speedboats but been repelled by security forces.“Some were shot down and others detained,” Reverol said in a televised statement, accusing the group of plotting to assassinate the leaders of Venezuela’s “revolutionary government”.Reverol said “a meticulous land, sea and air search” was under way to capture any remaining invaders, vowing: “We will remain in permanent state of alert and resistance.”In a telephone interview with the Washington Post on Sunday night, Goudreau claimed the operation had involved “60 troops”, including two former US special forces members, who had arrived in Venezuela by land and sea.Venezuela’s defense minister, who was last year accused of plotting against Maduro, appeared on state television flanked by armoured vehicles and heavily armed troops clutching assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade.“A group of mercenaries has attempted to trample our sacred soils and has received an emphatic response from our the weapons of our republic,” Vladimir Padrino López said, denouncing what he called a “crass” imperialist incursion. Padrino López said Maduro had ordered troops to scour the country’s Caribbean coastline for accomplices.The commotion comes almost a year to the day after a botched attempt to remove Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian successor from power.On 30 April 2019 opposition leader Juan Guaidó – who dozens of countries, including the US and UK, recognize as Venezuela’s legitimate interim leader – sought to spark a pre-dawn military uprising dubbed “Operation Freedom”.But those efforts fizzled and Maduro remains in power, albeit facing massive challenges as a result of Venezuela’s continued social and economic meltdown and now, the Covid-19 crisis, which doctors fear could bring the country’s crippled health system to its knees.Sunday’s supposed invasion is the latest chapter in the bizarre and shady tale of an apparently ongoing plot to overthrow Maduro that is being partly led by Goudreau, a sharpshooting, muscle-bound mixed martial arts enthusiast from Florida.In a lengthy report on Goudreau’s travails last week, the Associated Press claimed he had founded a private security company called Silvercorp USA in 2018 and last year decided to capitalize on Donald Trump’s obsession with overthrowing Maduro.The report said Goudreau subsequently came into contact with Clíver Alcalá, a retired Venezuelan army major general who has admitted to plotting against Maduro and handed himself over to US authorities in late March after being indicted in the US on drug trafficking charges.Alcalá reportedly told Goudreau he had three camps of willing combatants waiting near Colombia’s border with Venezuela and the American offered to train them for “a rapid-strike operation” to take out Maduro.Goudreau reportedly boasted of high-level contacts in the Trump administration but the news agency said it had found no evidence of US support for his actions.<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/venezuela-ex-us-soldier-says-141935507.html"><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V5S8az65NqsHb4wXKsD.JA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/96e4f1cd200322df4b26ba883deae6aa" width="130" height="86" alt="Venezuela: anti-Maduro battle isn&#39;t over as ex-US soldier says he launched raid" align="left" title="Venezuela: anti-Maduro battle isn&#39;t over as ex-US soldier says he launched raid" border="0" ></a>Jordan Goudreau, who was linked to plot to topple Maduro, said his troops are still in action as government said it foiled ‘invasion’  A former US special forces soldier linked to a murky and apparently bungled attempt to topple Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, has insisted his troops are still in action after launching “a daring amphibious raid” into the country.In a video released late on Sunday – hours after Maduro’s government claimed it had foiled a United States-backed sea “invasion” near Venezuela’s main international airport – Jordan Goudreau claimed the battle was not over.“Our men are continuing to fight right now,” claimed the 43-year-old American citizen, who was last week linked to what was described as an audacious but half-baked plot to invade Venezuela and remove its leader. “Our units have been activated in the south, west and east of Venezuela.”The former US special forces medic, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, offered no evidence for those claims and it was unclear where the video had been recorded.

The tightly packed crowd attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists.&gt; “We have to listen to the epidemiologist and health experts and displays like the one we saw at our capitol is not representative of who we are.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer reacts to protesters descending on her state’s capitol, including some who were armed. CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/lfPgGnpkGC&gt; &gt; — State of the Union (@CNNSotu) May 3, 2020Whitmer highlighted that the number of protesters was relatively small but that the imagery some of them used was a disturbing reminder of ugly elements of America’s past. “We know that people are not all happy about having to take the stay-home posture,” Whitmer said on Sunday, “and you know what, I’m not either. But we have to listen to the public health experts and displays like the one we saw in our state capitol are not representative of who we are in Michigan.“There were swastikas and Confederate flags and nooses and people with assault rifles. That’s a small group of people when you think that this is a state of almost 10 million people, the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing.”Displaying the Confederate flag, or other symbols of the slave-owning south during the American civil war, is usually seen as racist. While some claim they are celebrating southern identity, it is widely seen as a racist symbol deeply offensive to black Americans. There is also an ongoing campaign to remove Confederate war statues from public display or rename streets and buildings which commemorate Confederate generals or politicians.Last week, the Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who represents Michigan’s 13th congressional district, condemned the demonstrations at the state Capitol. “Black people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten State Legislators and staff,” Tlaib wrote in a tweet on Thursday.  &gt; Black people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten State Legislators and staff.   &gt;   &gt; ������Our gun laws are so broken. https://t.co/w6Vw97kTV9&gt; &gt; — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) April 30, 2020The protests continued to draw national attention on Friday when Trump once again threw his support behind the rightwing movement, saying Whitmer should “make a deal” with the demonstrators.“The governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” the president wrote on Twitter. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.”When asked if it was appropriate for the president to express support for protests in which “long guns” were carried on Friday afternoon, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said the president supported the right to protest within the law and while following federal social distancing guidelines.“The president says that we must protest lawfully and act within the bounds of the law,” said McEnany.The staggering effects of the pandemic among Whitmer’s electorate in terms of both illness and unemployment have placed a nationwide focus on Michigan, which is certain to be a key battleground state in the upcoming presidential election. The state had long been regarded as a Democratic stronghold but went for Trump four years ago, helping to spring his surprise electoral victory.<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/swastikas-nooses-governor-slams-racism-234906995.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Nu_THX9CcbOMb8K7ZwWP0A--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/a8ee4bf357db73aa64baccc177a33f28" width="130" height="86" alt="&#39;Swastikas and nooses&#39;: governor slams &#39;racism&#39; of Michigan lockdown protest" align="left" title="&#39;Swastikas and nooses&#39;: governor slams &#39;racism&#39; of Michigan lockdown protest" border="0" ></a>Gretchen Whitmer says heavily armed men and Confederate flags at state capitol ‘depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history’  * Coronavirus – latest US updates  * Coronavirus – latest global updates  * See all our coronavirus coverageGovernor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan issued a rebuke of the armed protesters who gathered inside the state capitol last week in defiance of statewide lockdown orders, saying the demonstrators embodied some of the “worst racism” of the nation’s history.“Some of the outrageousness of what happened at our capitol depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country,” Whitmer said during a Sunday interview on CNN’s State of the Union.Last week Donald Trump had said of the protesters: “These are very good people.”Hundreds of protesters, many not wearing protective face masks and some armed legally with “long guns”, gathered inside the statehouse in Lansing on Thursday as lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

The monster hornets – nicknamed &quot;murder hornets&quot; by researchers in the northwestern state of Washington – were first spotted late last year near Blaine, a town near the Canadian border. Known as the Vespa Mandarinia, the hornet is two inches long and is capable of stinging several times, which can prove fatal. It is estimated that they kill around 50 people a year in Japan alone. The hornets&#39; stingers are so long that they can penetrate beekeepers&#39; protective suits. Their toxic venom is equivalent to that of a poisonous snake, according to Jun-ichi Takahashi, a researcher at Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan. In all four hornet colonies were found in Washington and two more were discovered in British Columbia. The tell-tale sign was piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off. Just a handful of hornets can destroy a beehive in a matter of hours, according to Washington&#39;s department of agriculture. Having decapitated the bees during what is known as their &quot;slaughter phase&quot; the hornets then take control of the hive. They then use the bodies of the bees to feed their young. &quot;It&#39;s a shockingly large hornet,&quot; said Todd Murray, an entomologist at Washington State University. &quot;It&#39;s a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees,&quot; he added. &quot;They&#39;re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,&quot; said Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University&#39;s Department of Entomology. The hornets&#39; natural habitat is the forests and mountains of eastern and southeast Asia, where it has already devastated the local population of the European honeybee. How they arrived in North America remains unclear. One theory is that they might have been inadvertently transported in international cargo. Washington&#39;s department of agriculture has issued a chilling warning to local residents, telling them to use extreme caution should they come across a colony, even though they do not normally attack people or pets unless they feel threatened. &quot;Anyone who is allergic to bee or wasp stings should never approach an Asian giant hornet,&quot; it said. &quot;Don&#39;t try to take them out yourself if you see them,&quot; added Chris Looney, another state of Washington entomologist. &quot;If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we&#39;re going to have any hope of eradication.&quot;<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/us-bracing-invasion-monster-hornets-184204926.html"><img src="http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UVmJDtNdMAGFJd062G3apg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/01dad94d93f834426b4ace9116029e8f" width="130" height="86" alt="US bracing for invasion of monster hornets" align="left" title="US bracing for invasion of monster hornets" border="0" ></a>The US is facing an invasion of giant Asian hornets that scientists fear could threaten its bee population.

The hornets&#39; stingers are so long that they can penetrate beekeepers&#39; protective suits. Their toxic venom is equivalent to that of a poisonous snake, according to Jun-ichi Takahashi, a researcher at Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan. In all four hornet colonies were found in Washington and two more were discovered in British Columbia. The tell-tale sign was piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off. Just a handful of hornets can destroy a beehive in a matter of hours, according to Washington&#39;s department of agriculture. Having decapitated the bees during what is known as their &quot;slaughter phase&quot; the hornets then take control of the hive. They then use the bodies of the bees to feed their young. &quot;It&#39;s a shockingly large hornet,&quot; said Todd Murray, an entomologist at Washington State University. &quot;It&#39;s a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honeybees,&quot; he added. &quot;They&#39;re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,&quot; said Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University&#39;s Department of Entomology. The hornets&#39; natural habitat is the forests and mountains of eastern and southeast Asia, where it has already devastated the local population of the European honeybee. How they arrived in North America remains unclear. One theory is that they might have been inadvertently transported in international cargo. Washington&#39;s department of agriculture has issued a chilling warning to local residents, telling them to use extreme caution should they come across a colony, even though they do not normally attack people or pets unless they feel threatened. &quot;Anyone who is allergic to bee or wasp stings should never approach an Asian giant hornet,&quot; it said. &quot;Don&#39;t try to take them out yourself if you see them,&quot; added Chris Looney, another state of Washington entomologist. &quot;If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we&#39;re going to have any hope of eradication.&quot;<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/us-bracing-invasion-monster-hornets-184204926.html', 'pub_date': 'Sun, 03 May 2020 14:42:04 -0400', 'source': 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/', 'source_url': 'The Telegraph', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UVmJDtNdMAGFJd062G3apg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/01dad94d93f834426b4ace9116029e8f', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

As he looked closer, he saw a pile of dead members of the colony in front of a hive and more carnage inside -- thousands and thousands of bees with their heads torn from their bodies and no sign of a culprit.&quot;I couldn&#39;t wrap my head around what could have done that,&quot; McFall said.Only later did he come to suspect that the killer was what some researchers simply call the &quot;murder hornet.&quot;With queens that can grow to 2 inches long, Asian giant hornets can use mandibles shaped like spiked shark fins to wipe out a honeybee hive in a matter of hours, decapitating the bees and flying away with the thoraxes to feed their young. For larger targets, the hornet&#39;s potent venom and stinger -- long enough to puncture a beekeeping suit -- make for an excruciating combination that victims have likened to hot metal driving into their skin.In Japan, the hornets kill up to 50 people a year. Now, for the first time, they have arrived in the United States.McFall still is not certain that Asian giant hornets were responsible for the plunder of his hive. But two of the predatory insects were discovered last fall in the northwest corner of Washington state, a few miles north of his property -- the first sightings in the United States.Scientists have since embarked on a full-scale hunt for the hornets, worried that the invaders could decimate bee populations in the United States and establish such a deep presence that all hope for eradication could be lost.&quot;This is our window to keep it from establishing,&quot; said Chris Looney, an entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture. &quot;If we can&#39;t do it in the next couple of years, it probably can&#39;t be done.&quot;On a cold morning in early December, 2 1/2 miles to the north of McFall&#39;s property, Jeff Kornelis stepped on his front porch with his terrier-mix dog. He looked down to a jarring sight: &quot;It was the biggest hornet I&#39;d ever seen.&quot;The insect was dead, and after inspecting it, Kornelis had a hunch that it might be an Asian giant hornet. It did not make much sense, given his location in the world, but he had seen an episode of the YouTube personality Coyote Peterson getting a brutal sting from one of the hornets.Beyond its size, the hornet has a distinctive look, with a cartoonishly fierce face featuring teardrop eyes like Spider-Man, orange and black stripes that extend down its body like a tiger, and broad, wispy wings like a small dragonfly.Kornelis contacted the state, which came out to confirm that it was indeed an Asian giant hornet. Soon after, they learned that a local beekeeper in the area had also found one of the hornets.Looney said it was immediately clear that the state faced a serious problem, but with only two insects in hand and winter coming on, it was nearly impossible to determine how much the hornet had already made itself at home.Over the winter, state agriculture biologists and local beekeepers got to work, preparing for the coming season. Ruthie Danielsen, a beekeeper who has helped organize her peers to combat the hornet, unfurled a map across the hood of her vehicle, noting the places across Whatcom County where beekeepers have placed traps.&quot;Most people are scared to get stung by them,&quot; Danielsen said. &quot;We&#39;re scared that they are going to totally destroy our hives.&quot;Adding to the uncertainty -- and mystery -- were some other discoveries of the Asian giant hornet across the border in Canada.In November, a single hornet was seen in White Rock, British Columbia, perhaps 10 miles away from the discoveries in Washington state -- likely too far for the hornets to be part of the same colony. Even earlier, there had been a hive discovered on Vancouver Island, across a strait that probably was too wide for a hornet to have crossed from the mainland.Crews were able to track down the hive on Vancouver Island. Conrad Berube, a beekeeper and entomologist in the town of Nanaimo, was assigned to exterminate it.He set out at night, when the hornets would be in their nest. He put on shorts and thick sweatpants, then his bee suit. He donned Kevlar braces on his ankles and wrists.But as he approached the hive, he said, the rustling of the brush and the shine of his flashlight awakened the colony. Before he had a chance to douse the nest with carbon dioxide, he felt the first searing stabs in his leg -- through the bee suit and underlying sweatpants.&quot;It was like having red-hot thumbtacks being driven into my flesh,&quot; he said. He ended up getting stung at least seven times, some of the stings drawing blood.Jun-ichi Takahashi, a researcher at Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan, said the species had earned the &quot;murder hornet&quot; nickname there because its aggressive group attacks can expose victims to doses of toxic venom equivalent to that of a venomous snake; a series of stings can be fatal.The night he got stung, Berube still managed to eliminate the nest and collect samples, but the next day, his legs were aching, as if he had the flu. Of the thousands of times he has been stung in his lifetime of work, he said, the Asian giant hornet stings were the most painful.After collecting the hornet in the Blaine area, state officials took off part of a leg and shipped it to an expert in Japan. A sample from the Nanaimo nest was sent as well.A genetic examination, concluded over the past few weeks, determined that the nest in Nanaimo and the hornet near Blaine were not connected, said Telissa Wilson, a state pest biologist, meaning there had probably been at least two different introductions in the region.Looney went out on a recent day in Blaine, carrying clear jugs that had been made into makeshift traps; typical wasp and bee traps available for purchase have holes too small for the Asian giant hornet. He filled some with orange juice mixed with rice wine, others had kefir mixed with water, and a third batch was filled with some experimental lures -- all with the hope of catching a queen emerging to look for a place to build a nest.He hung them from trees, geotagging each location with his phone.In a region with extensive wooded habitats for hornets to establish homes, the task of finding and eliminating them is daunting. How to find dens that may be hidden underground? And where to look, given that one of the queens can fly many miles a day, at speeds of up to 20 mph?The miles of wooded landscapes and mild, wet climate of western Washington state make it an ideal location for the hornets to spread.In the coming months, Looney said, he and others plan to place hundreds more traps. State officials have mapped out the plan in a grid, starting in Blaine and moving outward.The buzz of activity inside a nest of Asian giant hornets can keep the inside temperature up to 86 degrees, so the trackers are also exploring using thermal imaging to examine the forest floors. Later, they may also try other advanced tools that could track the signature hum the hornets make in flight.If a hornet does get caught in a trap, Looney said, there are plans to possibly use radio-frequency identification tags to monitor where it goes -- or simply attach a small streamer and then follow the hornet as it returns to its nest.While most bees would be unable to fly with a disruptive marker attached, that is not the case with the Asian giant hornet. It is big enough to handle the extra load.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/tracking-murder-hornet-deadly-pest-153552586.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XN4ea37ioTdB_AjMMd0bsQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/66d89590-8d58-11ea-bcfe-c54ad632d5b2" width="130" height="86" alt="Tracking the &#39;Murder Hornet&#39;: A Deadly Pest Has Reached North America" align="left" title="Tracking the &#39;Murder Hornet&#39;: A Deadly Pest Has Reached North America" border="0" ></a>BLAINE, Wash. -- In his decades of beekeeping, Ted McFall had never seen anything like it.As he pulled his truck up to check on a group of hives near Custer, Washington, in November, he could spot from the window a mess of bee carcasses on the ground.

But they most likely won&#39;t be enough to address the problem if businesses remain closed for months.Over the next few weeks, the Department of Agriculture will begin spending $300 million a month to buy surplus vegetables, fruit, milk and meat from distributors and ship them to food banks. The federal grants will also subsidize boxing up the purchases and transporting them to charitable groups -- tasks that farmers have said they cannot afford, giving them few options other than to destroy the food.Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#39;s office has said New York will give food banks $25 million to buy products made from excess milk on farms in the state; the state is working with manufacturers like Chobani, Hood and Cabot to turn the milk into cheese, yogurt and butter. Some of the state subsidy can also be used to buy apples, potatoes and other produce that farms have in storage.Nationally, the Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States, has diverted almost a quarter of a million gallons of milk to food banks.&quot;It&#39;s just a drop in the bucket,&quot; said Jackie Klippenstein, a senior vice president at the co-op. &quot;But we had to do something.&quot;The closure of restaurants, hotels and school cafeterias wiped out huge sources of demand for fresh food, leaving farmers with millions of pounds of excess. While increased sales at grocery stores have made up for some of that, not since the Great Depression has so much fresh food been destroyed. (In the 1930s, the problem was that people could not afford to buy all the crops farmers were producing, which led the federal government to establish an early food stamp program.)The Agriculture Department grants are expected to be announced this week, but farmers say their losses far exceed what the grants can provide.&quot;These are not insolvable problems,&quot; said Marion Nestle, a food studies professor at New York University. &quot;These are problems that require a lot of people, sums of money and some thought. If the government were really interested in making sure that hungry people got fed and farmers were supported, they would figure out a way to do it.&quot;There are some signs that the waste is starting to dissipate. At the beginning of April, farmers were dumping 3.7 million gallons of milk each day, draining it into manure pits, where it mixed with fertilizer used in the fields. Now, the waste is closer to 1.5 million gallons, according to the dairy co-op, as farmers scale back production and restaurant chains like Papa John&#39;s heed the industry&#39;s call to add extra cheese to every pizza.Even as the waste declines for some food, other farmers are scrambling to find new buyers. California strawberry growers, for example, are reaching peak harvest season in May.&quot;Time is not on our side,&quot; said Mary Coppola, a vice president at the United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group of fruit and vegetable growers and processors. &quot;In my own personal opinion, we are not coming up with the supply-chain logistical solutions as quickly as produce is growing.&quot;Some people, upset by all the food waste when families are running low, are trying to come up with other solutions.A group of university students have started an online site, FarmLink, seeking to connect farmers with food banks. James Kanoff at Stanford and Aidan Reilly at Brown founded the group last month with donations from family and friends.So far, it has diverted 50,000 onions that were about to be destroyed on a farm in Oregon and paid for their transportation to Los Angeles, where they were distributed to food banks. The students also bought 10,000 eggs from a California farm, rented a truck and drove them to a large food bank.FarmLink, which now includes about 20 students from several colleges, has been cold-calling hundreds of farms to find surpluses.&quot;Just getting through to the farmers is the hardest part, because they are so busy,&quot; said Jordan Hartzell, a Brown student.The need at food banks is only increasing as the economic crisis intensifies. There are still long lines outside many food banks, as the charities struggle with a surge in need and a scarcity of volunteers because of stay-at-home orders.While the details are being worked out, the New York subsidy may allow dairy companies like Chobani to drive trucks of their products into neighborhoods with the most need and hand them out in a public park.At the small food pantry she runs in Casper, Wyoming, Mary Ann Budenske has seen shortages of staples like milk and eggs. On Thursday, a shipment of about 200 gallons of milk that arrived at 2:30 p.m. was half gone by 5. She has sent more than 20 emails to farmers and trade associations, offering to drive her 1998 Ford pickup truck to retrieve the leftover food herself.&quot;Pretty much I&#39;m getting the bureaucratic &#39;We&#39;re looking into that -- we&#39;ll get back in touch with you,&#39;&quot; Budenske said. &quot;The whole thing makes me sick.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2020 The New York Times Company<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/had-something-trying-prevent-massive-155440190.html"><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/glt_ZxS.ryfP.2m.2K2djw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/53852e90-8d62-11ea-bd6b-e57aa4802f56" width="130" height="86" alt="&#39;We Had to Do Something&#39;: Trying to Prevent Massive Food Waste" align="left" title="&#39;We Had to Do Something&#39;: Trying to Prevent Massive Food Waste" border="0" ></a>While millions of Americans are worried about having enough to eat and lines at food banks grow, farmers have been plowing under vegetable fields, dumping milk and smashing eggs that cannot be sold because the coronavirus pandemic has shut down restaurants, hotels and schools.Now, the destruction of fresh food on such a scale has prompted action by the Trump administration and state governments, as well as grassroots efforts like a group of college students who are renting trucks to rescue unsold onions and eggs from farms.

The sophomore at the University of Washington has come to a patch of grass in Seattle’s Magnuson Park to fill a void. This time of year, his club soccer team would normally be practicing and playing games.“We would be going to a national tournament right now,” Klein, who wears a long-sleeve purple T-shirt with a gold “W,” tells The Daily Beast.For now, he settles for some solo juggling—and a bit of daydreaming about when life in his college town, the first in the United States to go under COVID-19 lockdown, might emerge from the pandemic abyss.“I’m looking forward to things going back to normal, for things to open up again and for classes to be like they were before,” he says. “I’m struggling with the online thing. I’m struggling staying home and being away from everybody.”Don’t Forget the Other Pandemic Killing Thousands of AmericansOn Friday, Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) announced an extension of Washington State’s stay-at-home order through May 31. But he also detailed plans to begin reopening some businesses in mid-May—and confirmed that, starting this week, outdoor recreation like fishing, golf, and hiking in state parks will be allowed again with some restrictions.\xa0Back in early March, as COVID-19 emerged on both the West and East coasts, Seattle-area scientists and leaders seemed to be writing the playbook for the nation on how to curb a pandemic. The University of Washington was quick to move classes online, and as The New Yorker reported, Microsoft and other major local businesses asked their employees to work from home, demonstrating that such a transition could be relatively smooth.\xa0Overall, the state—which, to be sure, was the first to contend with a confirmed coronavirus case—was about two weeks ahead of the national average (March 27 versus April 10) in hitting a peak in social distancing behavior, according to analyses from the University of Maryland of anonymized smartphone location data. On April 6, less than two weeks later, deaths due to the disease peaked in the state.\xa0Now, with about half of U.S. states starting to ease restrictions—efforts to curtail further economic harm and cabin fever led by mostly GOP governors like Georgia’s Brian Kemp, and often without epidemiologists’ assent—Seattle’s cautious COVID-19 exit strategy may be the only model worth following.“We’ve been ahead of everyone in this country. We’ve made the right decisions when we’ve needed to make them and saved a lot of lives by doing so,” Ali Mokdad, a scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine who has modeled the pandemic’s trends, told The Daily Beast. “People can look at us and see what we’re opening, how we&#39;re doing it in a smart way—not by relaxing everything at one time.”“We have to be patient so that what we have sacrificed before is not wasted,” added Mokdad, a senior author on models Inslee has leaned on to chart the state’s course.The governor unveiled a four-phase plan for easing restrictions on Friday. The state will stagger each one by at least three weeks to allow the time needed to evaluate the changes and make any necessary adjustments, based on several models and metrics, including counts of confirmed cases, hospitalizations, testing capacity, case and contact investigations, and social distancing trends. (In a press conference last Wednesday, Inslee detailed the state’s plans to implement a rapid-response contact tracing workforce with 1,500 case investigators by May 11.)It’s a delicate task with high stakes and experts and local insiders hope it will mark a sharp contrast with how things began playing out in Texas, where cases surged as restrictions were eased.“I’d like to tell you we would all be able to make reservations on June 1. But I cannot,” Inslee said, tempering expectations of a return to normal.Contributing to the hesitation is the fact that approximately 95 percent of the region’s population remains susceptible to COVID-19, according to an analysis released on Friday by the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Washington. That’s actually a sign of local success. Social distancing behavior has curbed the number of infections. Transmission of the virus in King County (which includes Seattle) is declining. The group’s latest models estimate that the number of new cases stemming from each COVID-19 infection was 0.64 on April 15. This so-called effective reproductive number has remained below the critical threshold of 1 since March 29. But attached to such a success comes a failure to build up so-called herd immunity. Reversing behaviors too fast could risk rapidly reversing the declines in infections and deaths.“We need to make decisions based on hard-headed science and not wishes,” added Inslee. “We don’t want to do this twice.”Understandably, patience has not been easy for Americans with uncut hair, unfed children, and unpaid bills. Isolation alone is proving a significant burden for many.Starting in mid-April, analysis of smartphone location data shows a drop in social distancing behavior across the country, including in Washington State. Out of 10 people who had been staying home, on average one is no longer staying home, noted Lei Zhang, director of the Maryland Transportation Institute that conducted the analysis at the University of Maryland.\xa0“Quarantine fatigue” appeared to be setting in, he explained. The percentage of people staying at home peaked both nationally and in Washington State at 36 percent—albeit a couple weeks earlier in-state. As of April 24, that figure had dropped to 29 percent for both.\xa0“Without any intervention, we predict that this new trend of decreasing social distancing behavior will continue,” Zhang told The Daily Beast. “If we don’t make any changes, people are deciding already on their own when they are going to loosen up. That’s not good.”Zhang also noted that his data showed “a lot of trips crossing state borders and county borders,” an ominous trend as some states reopen sooner than others. “People need to rethink their summer vacation plans,” he said. “If you haven’t really self-quarantined yourself for 14 days at home, then you probably shouldn’t travel to other places.”Mokdad underscored the concern about people venturing out, noting that it matters more how people actually move and interact than what is open or closed. But he also flagged an important nuance. “The mobility of introducing 20,000 more people into circulation in a city today doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing as introducing 20,000 people one year ago,” he said, suggesting that adhering to social distancing rules, face masks, and regular hand-washing can mitigate the increased risks.Wendy Parmet, a professor of law and public policy at Northeastern University in Boston, highlighted the importance of deciphering why people may not be taking social distancing seriously. In particular, she lamented the patchwork of COVID-19 messages from national and state leaders.\xa0“How do you get people to buy into orders when the Vice President goes to the Mayo Clinic without a mask, and other leaders are poo-pooing it,” she said. “It wasn’t long ago that the Surgeon General told us not to wear masks.”\xa0“California and Washington appeared very early to be leaders in taking action, while much of the rest of the country remained in the illusion that somehow this wasn&#39;t coming,” added Parmet. “I don&#39;t think any state has done it perfectly—maybe they can’t in this environment.”\xa0The White House’s “Opening Up America Again” guidelines recommend a phased approach that many states have adopted to varying degrees. Some, like Georgia, haven’t even met those benchmarks.To know how to optimally proceed with any loosening of restrictions, it is helpful to understand what measures actually work. In March, restrictions were generally all implemented at once. “That makes it very difficult to say what contribution each change made in transmission rates,” Mike Famulare, a scientist with the Bellevue modeling group, told The Daily Beast. “As we go forward and changes to distancing policy are tried and time is taken to measure their consequences, we will learn more about what kinds of activities are relatively safe versus what are relatively high risk.”That information will be helpful in understanding what restrictions need to persist, and which ones may need to be reenacted down the line if and when COVID-19 cases rebound. Washington State’s stepwise strategy of using a dial calibrated to the data is “the right approach,” Thomas Tsai, a health policy researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, told The Daily Beast. “It needs to be a dynamic process, with the understanding that you may need to take a step back if testing data show cases starting to increase again.”The Heartbreaking ‘Last Shift’ of a New York City NurseOf course, obtaining valuable testing data requires having testing capacity. “Part of the tragedy of the last few months is that we were so limited on testing that we didn’t have an early warning system,” said Tsai. “We were always reactive and playing catch up to the reality on the ground.”As of the end of April, about 4,600 Washingtonians were being tested for COVID-19 each day. Testing capacity in the state is about 22,000, according to Inslee. An average of between 200,000 and 300,000 people per day are being tested for the coronavirus nationally. Dr. Anthony Fauci said during a webcast on April 25 that U.S. testing capacity should double within the next several weeks to about 500,000 per day, a figure that Tsai and colleagues suggest is the minimum needed in order to successfully reopen the economy.Tsai also warned that states should not become overconfident in their hospital capacity, flattening curves notwithstanding. “There will be a new wave of non-COVID patients who had been deferring their care coming back to the hospitals,” he said. “The demand is going to change dramatically after states reopen.”“Most states have passed their peaks and are hitting a plateau. But being on a plateau is not enough,” added Tsai. “We want to see us coming off the mountain.”During the early days of social distancing—before state and national parks closed, and barriers went up at trailheads—Klein had been escaping for hikes in the mountains outside Seattle. It’s not his passion, but now it seems like the closest he can get to something resembling normalcy as he waits for the city to reopen around him.“I miss person-to-person interactions more than anything,” Klein says. “That’s part of soccer. That&#39;s part of all sports. I just miss it.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the current president, gave no reason for Dariga Nazarbayeva’s surprise dismissal as senate speaker, but the decision comes shortly after a high-profile London court battle that exposed details of her vast personal fortune. Ms Nazarbayeva was made senate speaker last year when her father Nursultan Nazarbayev stepped down after almost 30 years as president, handing over to his protege Mr Tokayev. The speaker automatically takes power if the president resigns or is incapacitated, leading to speculation that 56-year-old Ms Nazarbayeva was positioning to succeed her father. Mr Nazarbayev still holds outsize influence in the ex-Soviet state and took the title “Leader of the Nation” after leaving the presidency, while Kazakhstan’s capital city Astana was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour last year. Family members amassed huge fortunes over Mr Nazarbayev’s decades in power, but journalists in Kazakhstan are forbidden by law from investigating this wealth. Details however came to light in a High Court battle in London in March, as Ms Nazarbayeva and her son sought to stop ‘McMafia’ laws being used to seize their £80-million property portfolio in the capital. The UK National Crime Agency had targeted three addresses it suspected were bought with the proceeds of crimes by Ms Nazarbayeva’s late ex-husband. They included a 10-bedroom mansion in an area of Hampstead, north London, known as Billionaires’ Row. The court overturned the Unexplained Wealth Orders - also known as ‘McMafia’ orders after the popular BBC drama - but the ruling brought attention to Ms Nazarbayeva’s business empire, which spans the sugar, car, banking and media industries. Forbes magazine last estimated her wealth in 2013 at $595 million, and she was named in the Panama Papers as the owner of an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands. Ms Nazarbayeva is also an amateur opera singer who has performed on Kazakh television and at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Political decision-making in Kazakhstan is opaque and it is not clear whether Mr Nazarbayev played a role in his daughter’s dismissal at the weekend, or whether she will be appointed to another position. President Tokayev thanked Ms Nazarbayeva for her “active and fruitful” service in a tweet. Mr Tokayev’s deputy chief of staff Maulen Ashimbayev became senate speaker in a reshuffle on Monday.<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kazakh-president-strips-predecessors-daughter-145804780.html"><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s8aYTD5VZDK0YzbTo1KfCA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/afa829528c452e17ac97932df66fae13" width="130" height="86" alt="Kazakh president strips predecessor&#39;s daughter of key role in aftermath of exposure of assets in the UK" align="left" title="Kazakh president strips predecessor&#39;s daughter of key role in aftermath of exposure of assets in the UK" border="0" ></a>The multi-millionaire daughter of Kazakhstan’s ex-president has been stripped of powers that would have put her first in line for the leadership of the oil-rich Central Asian nation.

Details however came to light in a High Court battle in London in March, as Ms Nazarbayeva and her son sought to stop ‘McMafia’ laws being used to seize their £80-million property portfolio in the capital. The UK National Crime Agency had targeted three addresses it suspected were bought with the proceeds of crimes by Ms Nazarbayeva’s late ex-husband. They included a 10-bedroom mansion in an area of Hampstead, north London, known as Billionaires’ Row. The court overturned the Unexplained Wealth Orders - also known as ‘McMafia’ orders after the popular BBC drama - but the ruling brought attention to Ms Nazarbayeva’s business empire, which spans the sugar, car, banking and media industries. Forbes magazine last estimated her wealth in 2013 at $595 million, and she was named in the Panama Papers as the owner of an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands. Ms Nazarbayeva is also an amateur opera singer who has performed on Kazakh television and at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Political decision-making in Kazakhstan is opaque and it is not clear whether Mr Nazarbayev played a role in his daughter’s dismissal at the weekend, or whether she will be appointed to another position. President Tokayev thanked Ms Nazarbayeva for her “active and fruitful” service in a tweet. Mr Tokayev’s deputy chief of staff Maulen Ashimbayev became senate speaker in a reshuffle on Monday.<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/kazakh-president-strips-predecessors-daughter-145804780.html', 'pub_date': 'Mon, 04 May 2020 10:58:04 -0400', 'source': 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/', 'source_url': 'The Telegraph', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s8aYTD5VZDK0YzbTo1KfCA--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/afa829528c452e17ac97932df66fae13', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

During an appearance on MSNBC&#39;s\xa0Morning Joe, Biden also denied that a search of his personal archives held by the University of Delaware would turn up any mention of Reade, saying that those records contain private conversations with world leaders that could be used as &quot;campaign fodder.&quot;Reade&#39;s account of the alleged assault has been corroborated in some aspects by testimony from friends and a former neighbor.The University of Delaware has refused to make the contents of Biden&#39;s archives available for research. The archives are under the direct control of the university&#39;s Board of Trustees, many of whose members have ties to Biden and have donated to his presidential campaign.<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/secretary-senate-says-office-cannot-155007118.html', 'pub_date': 'Mon, 04 May 2020 11:50:07 -0400', 'source': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/', 'source_url': 'National Review', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Tkv0LYFR0HpgjkZ7x_Kavg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/c228afe14c25f717756699bbbff786f6', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

On Saturday, North Korean state media released photos and video footage of him smiling, chatting and walking before a large crowd at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, which it said took place on Friday.Such reports are almost impossible to confirm. But after the photos appeared, South Korea -- which had repeatedly insisted there was &quot;nothing unusual&quot; happening in the North -- issued a strong rebuke about the various news reports that had suggested Kim was in peril.&quot;The groundless rumors about North Korea have caused various unnecessary economic, security and societal confusion and costs,&quot; the South&#39;s Unification Ministry said in a text message to reporters.Still, Kim&#39;s reappearance did nothing to explain the three-week absence from public view that led to the rumors, not least why he missed the important April 15 state ceremonies for the birth anniversary of his grandfather Kim Il-sung, North Korea&#39;s founder.And the speculation about Kim&#39;s well-being -- some reports had him in a &quot;vegetative state&quot; after botched heart surgery -- brought home an alarming fact: that the world simply doesn&#39;t know what would happen to the North and its nuclear arsenal should he suddenly die or become incapacitated.Unlike his grandfather and his father, Kim Jong-il, both of whom spent years grooming their chosen sons as successors, Kim, 36, \u200bhas no heir apparent. He is said to have three children, all too young to govern; his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, has become a trusted aide, but there is skepticism that the North&#39;s elderly generals would answer to a young woman.&quot;If anything, the past 10 days of frenzied speculation have revealed our weaknesses in intelligence and in reporting on what is happening inside North Korea,&quot; said Jean H. Lee, a North Korea expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. &quot;Regardless, it has refocused our attention on Kim, his health, stability in North Korea and the family&#39;s hold on power.&quot;Even the perception of a leadership vacuum in the North could have dangerous consequences, analysts say. Misinformation could lead to miscalculation or unintended escalations by one party or another.Over the decades, the rulers of the Kim dynasty have often disappeared from view for weeks or even months at a time. Each absence generated rumors of a coup, an assassination or a health crisis, always fueled by a lack of firsthand information about the leadership in Pyongyang, the capital.This time was no different. Even two North Korean defectors who were recently elected to the South&#39;s Parliament -- who might be expected to read the Pyongyang tea leaves better than most -- said they were sure Kim was either dead or seriously ill.&quot;One thing is clear\u200b,&quot; said one, \u200bThae Yong-ho, a former diplomat. &quot;He cannot stand up by himself or walk properly\u200b.&quot;Kim&#39;s latest absence came at a particularly sensitive time. Since his diplomacy with President Donald Trump stalled last year, Kim has dragged the North deeper into isolation, declaring that it was prepared for a prolonged standoff with Washington over its nuclear weapons program.But his plan to build a &quot;self-supporting&quot; economy in the face of international sanctions has been ambushed by the coronavirus, which forced North Korea to shut its borders. On Saturday, the state news agency said the fertilizer plant opened by Kim represented a &quot;great victory&quot; against the &quot;mean sanctions and pressure from hostile forces&quot; amid &quot;the global catastrophe caused by the malicious virus.&quot;North Korea insists that it has had no COVID-19 cases, but outside experts fear it could be hiding a significant outbreak. Harry Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest in Washington, said the likeliest explanation for Kim&#39;s absence was that he was &quot;taking steps to ensure his health or may have been impacted in some way personally by the virus.&quot; \u200bOne of the biggest lessons from recent weeks is that &quot;the world is largely unprepared for instability in North Korea,&quot; said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.Outside analysts fear that if Kim suddenly died, the country&#39;s dozens of nuclear devices -- as well as chemical and biological weapons, conventional arms and a 1.2 million-strong military -- would be at the center of a messy, cutthroat contest for power.\u200b&quot;The combination of loose nukes and political conflict is a nightmare scenario for the world\u200b,&quot; said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, who dealt with North Korea as a National Security Council director at the White House and an assistant secretary of state for Asia. \u200b&quot;Political turmoil could lead a faction or a commander to brandish or -- God forbid -- launch a nuclear-armed missile.&quot;Russel said that in the event of a leadership struggle, Washington&#39;s immediate \u200b\u200bpriority would be to ensure \u200b&quot;the security of North Korea&#39;s nuclear weapons and material\u200b.&quot; But its work would be &quot;handicapped by the intelligence community&#39;s uncertainty about their exact whereabouts -- something the North Koreans have gone to great lengths to conceal\u200b,&quot; he said.China also fears instability in North Korea, which it considers a buffer state between itself and U.S. forces in South Korea.Some analysts think China would intervene to secure the North&#39;s nuclear facilities and install a new leader to its liking, should Kim&#39;s rule end.

Until relatively recently, the United States was the world’s sole drone superpower, deploying Predators and Reapers to stalk terrorists across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. That’s no longer the case. In Libya over the last few months, a conflict that pits the Turkish-backed government in Tripoli against U.A.E.-backed forces has seen drones deployed by both sides. Iran unveiled an army of new drones fitted with anti-tank\xa0missiles in April, and China is exporting drones to traditional U.S. allies in the Middle East. Yet Washington is reticent to export its own drone technology and has watched as American drones\xa0were downed in Yemen, the Persian Gulf, and Libya. What went wrong?Military drone technology was pioneered by Israel in the 1980s and later developed by the U.S. to fight the global war on terror. But success brought complacency, and in recent years\xa0countries such\xa0as China, Turkey, Iran, and Russia have made rapid progress in building their own drones. Of greater concern is that China, Iran, and Turkey are also exporting armed drones. This is a result of two trends: the U.S. preference not to sell its armed drones in order to keep the deadly technology from proliferating, and the desire by other countries to acquire these weapons from whoever will make them available. For instance, the U.A.E. had sought armed U.S. drones since the early 2000s; it was eventually allowed to buy\xa0unarmed Predators\xa0in 2013, and it has turned to China to fill some of its other drone needs. Since 2015, lawmakers have been pushing the\xa0Trump administration to\xa0allow the sale of armed versions.Similarly, the Kingdom of Jordan, a close U.S. ally,\xa0turned to China after\xa02015 when its requests for armed\xa0drones were\xa0rebuffed.\xa0At the time, Representative Duncan Hunter\xa0pushed for the Obama administration to change its rules to permit sales to Jordan. The Pentagon has warned for years that China is\xa0filling the vacuum\xa0left by U.S. stalling on drone sales. An American official warned last year that China was “selling the hell out of drones” in the Gulf and elsewhere.That U.S. allies or partners such as Jordan, the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt are turning to China for drones is only one issue facing Washington in the global drone wars. Drones are increasingly playing a role in conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Libya. Iran has exported drone technology to Yemen’s Houthi rebels, smuggling parts on dhows that ply the trade routes from Iran to North Africa. In November 2019 and February 2020,\xa0the U.S. Navy intercepted\xa0dhows loaded with Iranian weapons technology bound for Yemen. The Houthis have used drones against Saudi Arabia for years, deploying them to target U.S.-supplied\xa0Patriot missile radar. Iran also exported\xa0its Shahed 129\xa0drone, which is a copy\xa0of the U.S. Predator, to Syria for testing during the country’s civil war. In recent interviews\xa0Iranian military officers\xa0have bragged about their new drone tech and boasted that they have shot down U.S. drones.While China has been selling drones to U.S. allies and Iran is using drones against U.S. interests, Turkey is also\xa0upping its armed\xa0drone forces\xa0and exporting\xa0them. Despite arms embargoes, Turkey has been sending\xa0drones to Libya to back one side in the civil war there, fueling the growing conflict. The drones have helped the interim government in Tripoli, the Government of National Accord, to hold\xa0off an offensive by Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by Egypt, the U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia and whose forces, according to Turkish media, get Chinese-made\xa0drones from the U.A.E. Washington could write off the Libya conflict as a proxy war in which both sides have support from U.S. allies, but such a dismissal has significant implications. Russian air defenses, sent to\xa0Libya, downed a U.S. drone last year. Libya, Yemen, and Syria have become testing grounds for new military drone technology used by Turkey and Iran and exported from China.U.S. exports of armed drones have been hamstrung by provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime, which is an\xa0agreement among 35\xa0countries regulating missile and drone exports. That agreement kept the U.S. and other signatories from selling large drones with warheads, but it gave free rein to\xa0countries such as China and Iran, which were not signatories. Even as Trump\xa0administration policy has shifted toward drone exports, the vacuum was being filled by other countries. Adversaries such as Russia are always going to seize the opportunity to test their technology on the ground. To wit, Russian air defense has improved by using Syria as a test bed. Iran similarly benefited from seeing how its drones perform against U.S. air-defense technology in Saudi Arabia.

Until relatively recently, the United States was the world’s sole drone superpower, deploying Predators and Reapers to stalk terrorists across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. That’s no longer the case. In Libya over the last few months, a conflict that pits the Turkish-backed government in Tripoli against U.A.E.-backed forces has seen drones deployed by both sides. Iran unveiled an army of new drones fitted with anti-tank\xa0missiles in April, and China is exporting drones to traditional U.S. allies in the Middle East. Yet Washington is reticent to export its own drone technology and has watched as American drones\xa0were downed in Yemen, the Persian Gulf, and Libya. What went wrong?Military drone technology was pioneered by Israel in the 1980s and later developed by the U.S. to fight the global war on terror. But success brought complacency, and in recent years\xa0countries such\xa0as China, Turkey, Iran, and Russia have made rapid progress in building their own drones. Of greater concern is that China, Iran, and Turkey are also exporting armed drones. This is a result of two trends: the U.S. preference not to sell its armed drones in order to keep the deadly technology from proliferating, and the desire by other countries to acquire these weapons from whoever will make them available. For instance, the U.A.E. had sought armed U.S. drones since the early 2000s; it was eventually allowed to buy\xa0unarmed Predators\xa0in 2013, and it has turned to China to fill some of its other drone needs. Since 2015, lawmakers have been pushing the\xa0Trump administration to\xa0allow the sale of armed versions.Similarly, the Kingdom of Jordan, a close U.S. ally,\xa0turned to China after\xa02015 when its requests for armed\xa0drones were\xa0rebuffed.\xa0At the time, Representative Duncan Hunter\xa0pushed for the Obama administration to change its rules to permit sales to Jordan. The Pentagon has warned for years that China is\xa0filling the vacuum\xa0left by U.S. stalling on drone sales. An American official warned last year that China was “selling the hell out of drones” in the Gulf and elsewhere.That U.S. allies or partners such as Jordan, the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt are turning to China for drones is only one issue facing Washington in the global drone wars. Drones are increasingly playing a role in conflicts in Syria, Yemen, and Libya. Iran has exported drone technology to Yemen’s Houthi rebels, smuggling parts on dhows that ply the trade routes from Iran to North Africa. In November 2019 and February 2020,\xa0the U.S. Navy intercepted\xa0dhows loaded with Iranian weapons technology bound for Yemen. The Houthis have used drones against Saudi Arabia for years, deploying them to target U.S.-supplied\xa0Patriot missile radar. Iran also exported\xa0its Shahed 129\xa0drone, which is a copy\xa0of the U.S. Predator, to Syria for testing during the country’s civil war. In recent interviews\xa0Iranian military officers\xa0have bragged about their new drone tech and boasted that they have shot down U.S. drones.While China has been selling drones to U.S. allies and Iran is using drones against U.S. interests, Turkey is also\xa0upping its armed\xa0drone forces\xa0and exporting\xa0them. Despite arms embargoes, Turkey has been sending\xa0drones to Libya to back one side in the civil war there, fueling the growing conflict. The drones have helped the interim government in Tripoli, the Government of National Accord, to hold\xa0off an offensive by Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by Egypt, the U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia and whose forces, according to Turkish media, get Chinese-made\xa0drones from the U.A.E. Washington could write off the Libya conflict as a proxy war in which both sides have support from U.S. allies, but such a dismissal has significant implications. Russian air defenses, sent to\xa0Libya, downed a U.S. drone last year. Libya, Yemen, and Syria have become testing grounds for new military drone technology used by Turkey and Iran and exported from China.U.S. exports of armed drones have been hamstrung by provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime, which is an\xa0agreement among 35\xa0countries regulating missile and drone exports. That agreement kept the U.S. and other signatories from selling large drones with warheads, but it gave free rein to\xa0countries such as China and Iran, which were not signatories. Even as Trump\xa0administration policy has shifted toward drone exports, the vacuum was being filled by other countries. Adversaries such as Russia are always going to seize the opportunity to test their technology on the ground. To wit, Russian air defense has improved by using Syria as a test bed. Iran similarly benefited from seeing how its drones perform against U.S. air-defense technology in Saudi Arabia. This is not to say that the U.S. should be fueling conflicts in places like Libya by selling drones to militants, but rather that it needs to take a more active role to confront the export and trafficking of drones and make sure adversaries don’t benefit from these conflicts to outpace us.Washington must now concentrate on the drone threat and decide how U.S. drone technology can best be used to confront Iran, China, Russia, and other adversaries. Making sure that U.S. drones continue to measure up on the battlefield will be essential in any future conflict. Recent incidents in which U.S. drones were shot down have provided a clear warning of worse to come.<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/u-risks-losing-drone-war-103037969.html', 'pub_date': 'Mon, 04 May 2020 06:30:37 -0400', 'source': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/', 'source_url': 'National Review', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9RMipcV4oJo378L5A6JXBg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/c3ad63991d42f4fd00326cff3559b749', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

Larry Hogan, his counterpart in Maryland, called it “complete nonsense”. Congressman Pete King of New York said it was the work of the “Marie Antoinette of the Senate”.It would be an understatement to say Mitch McConnell’s suggestion that state and local governments should declare bankruptcy rather than seek more federal funding went down like a lead balloon. It was a rare instance of the Senate majority leader overplaying his hand.It also showed that Donald Trump is not the only figure embodying liberal nightmares in the time of coronavirus. When historians contemplate a death toll in the tens of thousands and an economy fallen off a cliff, they will pay close attention to the president’s most important ally.“I think Mitch McConnell is the guy to be watching and focusing on in terms of what’s going on,” said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. “His messaging around the coronavirus has been tone deaf.“It’s not just the fact that McConnell was remarkably brutal in pairing Americans into red and blue states at a time of national crisis – that is pretty shameless – but I think it was also politically inept because he’s got his colleagues in tough races in blue states.”McConnell’s role in the pandemic drama has been criticised. On 12 March, just before Trump declared a national emergency, the senator flew back to Kentucky for a celebration for Justin Walker, a young rightwing judge nominated to America’s second highest court. The ill-timed absence was noted. “WheresMitch?” trended on Twitter.With the economy in a tailspin, Senate Republicans came up with emergency funding. But it was skewed in favour of corporate executives and shareholders. Democrats refused it. A New York Times editorial was headlined: “The Coronavirus Bailout Stalled. And It’s Mitch McConnell’s Fault.”Democrats forced concessions in a record $2.2tn bill that increased support to workers and reduced handouts to business, though these still amounted to what critics called a $500bn “corporate slush fund”.Trump was earning global opprobrium for his bungling of the pandemic, but it was apparently too late for McConnell to untether himself from the president, even if he so desired. Instead, he blamed Democrats for impeaching Trump.“[The coronavirus] came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial,” McConnell told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And I think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment.”Opponents saw that as a feeble attempt to excuse the inexcusable.Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, said: “Almost any good Mitch McConnell did by cooperating and collaborating on the legislative side is undone by his enabling of the president at a time when he could have been a real leader and called out the president on his lack of responsiveness and leadership.“It’s disappointing because he had the chance to redeem himself from all the negative and enabling and divisiveness of the past several years as the majority leader and he didn’t take it.Vela, a board director of TransparentBusiness, added: “Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are battling for who is the greatest hypocrite in our nation – it’s like they’re competing for the hypocrisy trophy. It’s not about unity, it’s not about bringing the American people together at a time of crisis. For McConnell and Trump, it’s all about politics and power.”Last week McConnell retreated from his much-derided position on “blue state bailouts” and bankruptcy, indicating he would consider funds in the next relief bill for state and local governments struggling to pay police and firefighters.“There’s no question all governors, regardless of party, would like to have more money, I’m open to discussing that,” he said on Fox News Radio.But he sailed into fresh controversy by insisting that senators, unlike their counterparts in the House, return to work on Monday. Washington DC remains a virus hotspot. At least one senator, eight Capitol police officers and 11 workers have tested positive. Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland warned that “without effective safeguards in place, Mitch McConnell is endangering the lives of the staff”.Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, condemned McConnell for priorities that include confirming Walker and demanded oversight hearings into the White House’s “dreadful response to this public health crisis”.Schumer said: “The American people are demanding answers and solutions – Senator McConnell ought to focus the Senate’s work on the crises caused by Covid-19, not rightwing judges or fulfilling his ‘pre-existing partisan wishlist’ of protecting big business from any harm done to the American people.”Another confrontation is looming, over the next stimulus package. McConnell is insisting on protections for businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits as states reopen. Democrats warn workers’ health could be jeopardised.Public Citizen, a corporate and government watchdog, tweeted: “McConnell is now refusing to pass ANY stimulus bill that doesn’t include TOTAL LEGAL IMMUNITY for corporations that get people sick [with] the coronavirus. It’s abhorrent. It’s also totally impractical. How can we reopen the economy if companies have no incentive to keep us safe?”Trump and McConnell appear bound together. Should the president lose in November, he could bring down Senate Republicans – perhaps even McConnell in Kentucky. Challenger Amy McGrath, a fighter pilot, outraised McConnell in the first three months of this year.Defeat would be an ignominious end to a divisive career. Kurt Bardella, a former senior adviser for the House oversight committee, said: “History will not look back on Mitch McConnell kindly. He has been the most effective enabler of Donald Trump.“Everything Trump has inflicted on the American people has been done with the blessing of McConnell. Through this entire coronavirus pandemic, McConnell has displayed he is a soulless person who is willing to let people suffer so he can continue to wield power.”<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/mitch-mcconnell-could-yet-pay-070014301.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iajo.TzEs4dON.NpAJJyyw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/6873d7813f0bc938d65ff7c47b83f4d5" width="130" height="86" alt="Mitch McConnell could yet pay price for &#39;tone deaf&#39; coronavirus response" align="left" title="Mitch McConnell could yet pay price for &#39;tone deaf&#39; coronavirus response" border="0" ></a>The Senate majority leader oversaw a huge handout to big business and drew bipartisan ire for suggesting struggling states should go bankrupt  * Coronavirus – latest US updates  * Coronavirus – latest global updates  * See all our coronavirus coverageIt was, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo observed, “one of the really dumb ideas of all time”.

When historians contemplate a death toll in the tens of thousands and an economy fallen off a cliff, they will pay close attention to the president’s most important ally.“I think Mitch McConnell is the guy to be watching and focusing on in terms of what’s going on,” said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. “His messaging around the coronavirus has been tone deaf.“It’s not just the fact that McConnell was remarkably brutal in pairing Americans into red and blue states at a time of national crisis – that is pretty shameless – but I think it was also politically inept because he’s got his colleagues in tough races in blue states.”McConnell’s role in the pandemic drama has been criticised. On 12 March, just before Trump declared a national emergency, the senator flew back to Kentucky for a celebration for Justin Walker, a young rightwing judge nominated to America’s second highest court. The ill-timed absence was noted. “WheresMitch?” trended on Twitter.With the economy in a tailspin, Senate Republicans came up with emergency funding. But it was skewed in favour of corporate executives and shareholders. Democrats refused it. A New York Times editorial was headlined: “The Coronavirus Bailout Stalled. And It’s Mitch McConnell’s Fault.”Democrats forced concessions in a record $2.2tn bill that increased support to workers and reduced handouts to business, though these still amounted to what critics called a $500bn “corporate slush fund”.Trump was earning global opprobrium for his bungling of the pandemic, but it was apparently too late for McConnell to untether himself from the president, even if he so desired. Instead, he blamed Democrats for impeaching Trump.“[The coronavirus] came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial,” McConnell told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “And I think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment.”Opponents saw that as a feeble attempt to excuse the inexcusable.Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, said: “Almost any good Mitch McConnell did by cooperating and collaborating on the legislative side is undone by his enabling of the president at a time when he could have been a real leader and called out the president on his lack of responsiveness and leadership.“It’s disappointing because he had the chance to redeem himself from all the negative and enabling and divisiveness of the past several years as the majority leader and he didn’t take it.Vela, a board director of TransparentBusiness, added: “Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are battling for who is the greatest hypocrite in our nation – it’s like they’re competing for the hypocrisy trophy. It’s not about unity, it’s not about bringing the American people together at a time of crisis. For McConnell and Trump, it’s all about politics and power.”Last week McConnell retreated from his much-derided position on “blue state bailouts” and bankruptcy, indicating he would consider funds in the next relief bill for state and local governments struggling to pay police and firefighters.“There’s no question all governors, regardless of party, would like to have more money, I’m open to discussing that,” he said on Fox News Radio.But he sailed into fresh controversy by insisting that senators, unlike their counterparts in the House, return to work on Monday. Washington DC remains a virus hotspot. At least one senator, eight Capitol police officers and 11 workers have tested positive. Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland warned that “without effective safeguards in place, Mitch McConnell is endangering the lives of the staff”.Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, condemned McConnell for priorities that include confirming Walker and demanded oversight hearings into the White House’s “dreadful response to this public health crisis”.Schumer said: “The American people are demanding answers and solutions – Senator McConnell ought to focus the Senate’s work on the crises caused by Covid-19, not rightwing judges or fulfilling his ‘pre-existing partisan wishlist’ of protecting big business from any harm done to the American people.”Another confrontation is looming, over the next stimulus package. McConnell is insisting on protections for businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits as states reopen. Democrats warn workers’ health could be jeopardised.Public Citizen, a corporate and government watchdog, tweeted: “McConnell is now refusing to pass ANY stimulus bill that doesn’t include TOTAL LEGAL IMMUNITY for corporations that get people sick [with] the coronavirus. It’s abhorrent. It’s also totally impractical. How can we reopen the economy if companies have no incentive to keep us safe?”Trump and McConnell appear bound together. Should the president lose in November, he could bring down Senate Republicans – perhaps even McConnell in Kentucky. Challenger Amy McGrath, a fighter pilot, outraised McConnell in the first three months of this year.Defeat would be an ignominious end to a divisive career. Kurt Bardella, a former senior adviser for the House oversight committee, said: “History will not look back on Mitch McConnell kindly. He has been the most effective enabler of Donald Trump.“Everything Trump has inflicted on the American people has been done with the blessing of McConnell. Through this entire coronavirus pandemic, McConnell has displayed he is a soulless person who is willing to let people suffer so he can continue to wield power.”<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/mitch-mcconnell-could-yet-pay-070014301.html', 'pub_date': 'Mon, 04 May 2020 03:00:14 -0400', 'source': 'https://www.theguardian.com/international', 'source_url': 'The Guardian', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iajo.TzEs4dON.NpAJJyyw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/6873d7813f0bc938d65ff7c47b83f4d5', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

Maybe it will give voters some context as to why he voted to repeal Glass–Steagall, the supposed root of the 2007 great recession?\xa0Or why he advocated against green-lighting the raid that killed Osama bin Laden?These days, Biden likes to pretend he was a fierce opponent of the invasion of Iraq, when in reality he turned critical only after the democracy-building went south. Biden stood in front of Congress in 2002, as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and argued for war.The historic record already shows that Biden was far more than just “civil” with segregationists early in his career: He engaged in obsequious efforts to gain their trust for committee seats and worked with them on issues such as busing.While in the Senate, Biden supported virtually every expansion of the drug war and mass incarceration, co-authoring\xa0the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Biden gave passionate speeches on the Senate floor arguing that one could be a “progressive” and “lock the SOBs up.” Now Biden claims to regret 1990s crime bill, calling it a “big mistake.”Maybe Biden’s papers can provide some ideological framework to his recent embrace of an extremist abortion position as well. In 1976, Biden voted for the Hyde Amendment, a somewhat toothless law banning federal funds to pay for abortion. (In 1993, he voted\xa0to save\xa0the Hyde Amendment.) Today, Biden supports overturning the Hyde Amendment and believes that taxpayers should fund the procedure on demand until crowning. There still exists a “Biden amendment,” which was added to the Foreign Assistance Act in 1981 to ban American aid from being used in research related to abortions.

Biden has never explained himself on most of these flip-flops.It’s unlikely that most Democratic Party voters (or any voters) are acutely concerned with a politician’s malleable policy positions. They want Trump gone. Yet setting aside the hypocritical standards and coverage of sexual-abuse allegations, both the media’s and his own, release of these papers would probably force Biden, who struggles to articulate much of anything these days, to explain why he’s made a 180 on virtually all notable policy stances. As a recent New York magazine piece put it, Biden is at his best when he’s neither speaking nor appearing in public. For Democrats, Biden is best because Biden is not Trump.As his papers would likely prove, that’s about it.<p><br clear="all">', 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/real-reason-joe-biden-won-213621327.html', 'pub_date': 'Mon, 04 May 2020 17:36:21 -0400', 'source': 'https://www.nationalreview.com/', 'source_url': 'National Review', 'media_content': [{'height': '86', 'url': 'http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qMr6iY8Z91evhnmSP2gXqg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/168e57278721a409888bfc37439cc4e1', 'width': '130'}], 'profile_name': 'us_yahoonews_rss'}

John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) draws on some unusual sources of information.\xa0Ratcliffe’s official, verified campaign Twitter account follows several accounts on the political fringe, including a 9/11 truther account with just one follower besides himself and four promoting the outlandish QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that the world is run by a cabal of Democratic pedophile-cannibals—and has been ruled a potential source of domestic terrorism by the FBI.\xa0The conspiracy theorists followed by Ratcliffe, whose nomination for director of national intelligence goes before the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday morning, cover a bizarre range of beliefs. They posit that John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his death to help Trump to take down the Deep State. Others claim a Democratic sex dungeon exists in in a Washington pizzeria. But Ratcliffe and the QAnon promoters he follows have one thing in common: utter loyalty to Trump.Even before Ratcliffe’s QAnon interest was known, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), a committee member, told The Daily Beast, “Congressman Ratcliffe is a partisan politician who has spent the last two years promoting conspiracy theories in defense of Donald Trump.”It’s not clear whether Ratcliffe followed conspiracy theorists himself, or whether it was done by someone else with access to his Twitter account. The QAnon accounts Ratcliffe follows were first noted by CQ Roll Call editor Ryan Kelly on Twitter. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions about Ratcliffe’s Twitter account to his congressional office, which didn’t respond to a request for comment.\xa0Veteran intelligence officials expressed alarm that the Senate may soon confirm a Trump loyalist atop the U.S.’s 16 intelligence agencies. “Ratcliffe would be the least qualified person to run the intelligence community, ever, and that includes Ric Grenell,” said former CIA and National Counterterrorism Center analyst Aki Peritz, referring to the acting director of national intelligence. “The hardest job for any intelligence officer is to speak truth to power. Based on Ratcliffe’s past performance, it’s doubtful he can resist the urge to politicize intelligence on behalf of Donald Trump.”\xa0The willingness of a likely director of national intelligence to entertain conspiracy theorists highlights what Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee consider Ratcliffe’s lack of fitness for the job. Two committee sources said the minority Democrats intend to press the nominee on his loyalty to Trump—the quality that earned Ratcliffe his nomination—something he displayed with zeal in attacking Robert Mueller’s Russia inquiry and portraying the House Democrats’ impeachment of Trump as a frame-up job.\xa0At Tuesday’s hearing, the Democrats intend to bring up everything from Russia to the novel coronavirus, where a divide has emerged between the intelligence agencies and the administration over whether the virus was man-made in China. They intend also to question Ratcliffe over the post-impeachment purge of intelligence officials, including several from the office of the director of national intelligence, most recently inspector general Michael Atkinson.\xa0“He has little experience in intelligence, and already had to withdraw his nomination once after lying about his resume. The pandemic has shown how putting unqualified loyalists in critical jobs leads to disaster,” said Wyden. “Any Republican who cares for the security of our country should think hard about the consequences of supporting the least qualified, most partisan person ever nominated for DNI.”But that attests to the expectation on the committee for a party-line vote—which will be enough to advance Ratcliffe’s nomination to the full Senate, where his confirmation can proceed on the same basis.\xa0Opposition to Ratcliffe was bipartisan the last time Trump nominated him to run Liberty Crossing, the DNI’s headquarters, in 2019. It lasted a week before Ratcliffe withdrew, following reporting on his false claim to have arrested 300 undocumented immigrants in a single day.\xa0Trump Intel Pick John Ratcliffe Started Theory of FBI Anti-Trump ‘Secret Society’At the time, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), the intelligence-committee chair, mixed a pledge of support with an acknowledgement of Ratcliffe’s limitations. “Can you find somebody that&#39;s got more experience, that&#39;s got more experience specifically in the intelligence community? Sure, but I&#39;m not sure that the DNI requires that,” Burr said in July. This time around, Burr gave Ratcliffe both unqualified support and dared committee Democrats to “have [Richard] Grenell stay on as acting” director.That’s a reference to Trump’s current interim director, the ambassador to Germany, another loyalist. Grenell oversaw Atkinson’s firing and the removal of other officials at the office of the director of national intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center. Last month, he rejected House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff’s request for information on the purges, as well as a pledge Schiff requested that “officials, including yourself, will not permit retaliation or reprisals against anyone who has made, or in the future makes, protected disclosures of misconduct to Congress or to Inspectors General.”\xa0A member of the House intelligence committee during his brief tenure in Congress, Ratcliffe has distinguished himself in a crowded field by blocking and tackling for Trump. “You managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis,” Ratcliffe told Mueller in July.\xa0During the impeachment hearings last fall, Ratcliffe insisted that Trump’s insistence on Ukraine publicly accusing Joe Biden’s son of corruption was no more than an effort to fight corruption in that country. He continued, with relevance to his possible next position, “the president, as the unitary executive, is the executive branch,” a reference to a highly disputed constitutional theory popular in certain corners of the right.What Is QAnon? The Craziest Theory of the Trump Era, Explained“The president can and should ask for assistance in ongoing criminal investigations,” Ratcliffe said, even though there was no criminal investigation into Biden or his son at the time.\xa0Ratcliffe’s decision to follow conspiracy theory accounts raises other questions. In Ratcliffe’s Twitter feed, accounts with names like “Hobbit Frog” and “Political Madness” pump out tweets that portray Trump not just as a great president, but as a messianic figure poised to use the military and intelligence agencies to purge the country of top Democrats—either through executions or with military show trials and prison terms in Guantanamo Bay.The QAnon accounts Ratcliffe follows often go to extremes. In a graphic posted by one of the accounts, a screaming Trump rescues crying children from a demonic Hillary Clinton—accompanied by text accusing Clinton of conducting child sacrifices. Another posits that Vincent Fusca, a Trump supporter some QAnon believers claim is John F. Kennedy Jr. in disguise, conducted a secret arrest of former President George H. W. Bush.\xa0QAnon has started to have a dangerous effect in the real world. Two QAnon believers have been charged with murder, while two others have been involved in alleged child abduction plots. A QAnon believer pleaded guilty in February to committing a terrorist incident near the Hoover Dam. Last week, a QAnon supporter live-streamed a trip to New York City to &quot;take out&quot; former Vice President Joe Biden. She was eventually arrested on weapons charges. Discomfort between presidential administrations and the intelligence agencies is supposed to reflect the occasionally divergent prerogatives of both. But the involvement of career intelligence officials in the investigations of Trump that have negatively characterized his presidency has poisoned the relationship, with Ratcliffe being the latest sign of White House hostility to an independent intelligence community.\xa0“Ratcliffe’s nomination to be DNI shows the bench to serve Trump at the highest levels has dwindled down to nutters, quislings, and television cranks,” Peritz said. “Anyone with any intelligence knows to decline these positions. Still, the nation continues to pay the price.”\xa0Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast hereGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

Demonstrations took place from the capital, Sacramento, to San Francisco and San Diego. Large crowds turned out in Orange county’s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after the governor had ordered beaches there to close over the weekend.Newsom acknowledged that some California regions would still require stricter guidelines than the state guidelines in the weeks to come.The six Bay Area counties that were the first in the country to issue a stay-at-home order, for example, have experienced a much higher rate of infection than more rural areas of the state, with more than 8,100 cases. Los Angeles, meanwhile, has seen more than 26,000 cases.Last week, rural Yuba and Sutter counties, located north of Sacramento, issued a measure that defied the state’s order and reopened businesses starting Monday. Modoc county, located on the Nevada border, was the first to begin pushing for a reopening.     “Our rural lifestyle and the fact that many of our residents have been abiding by the guidelines has kept us at zero,” said Tex Dowdy, the Modoc county sheriff, in a statement. “We are the perfect choice to pilot a reopening in the state.”As of Monday, California was reporting 53,616 positive cases and 2,215 deaths. Newsom has been adamant that any modification to the stay-at-home order be based on science and the state meeting certain criteria such as having capacity to meet a surge in healthcare needs, having enough personal protective equipment and having testing and trace-contacting capacity.Nearly 3,000 protested at Huntington Beach in southern California after Newsom closed the beaches in Orange county following a weekend heatwave that packed the coastline.Thousands more still flocked to the beaches this past weekend, some in protest and some for fun. In Carlsbad in San Diego county, where a red tide algae bloom is creating its annual blue bioluminescence at night, more than 1,000 people crowded along the coastline – even though the beaches were closed, said Bryan Hargett, a Carlsbad police lieutenant. Police stopped and reminded the nighttime beachgoers of the rules, and issued parking citations for those who didn’t listen – around 20 to 30 total, Hargett said.“We get it, we understand people probably want to get outside and enjoy the beaches and see this, but we’re all trying to follow the rules and do the right thing to get us back to normal,” he said.In Newport Beach, where seven miles of beaches are closed by state order, about 8,500 people still took to the shore on Saturday, and 4,500 on Sunday, said John Pope, a city spokesman. “It sounds like a big number, but it’s a small fraction of what we would typically see on weekends when the beaches were still open,” he said.The beachgoers came even as officials worked to abide by the governor’s order, conducting sweeps during the busiest parts of the days and clearing people off the beaches, using announcements from a police helicopter and bullhorns as well as talking directly to individuals.“Some of them said they hadn’t heard [about the beach closures] and in some cases, they were being deliberately defiant,” Pope said. “Some said they were coming down to the beach to stage a protest.”Pope said the city was “cautiously optimistic” that Newsom’s announcement on businesses meant there may soon be movement on beaches. The city has filed a plan with the state on how to reopen the beaches safely, Pope said, and “we’re confident we can manage the beaches effectively, maintain social distancing and minimize the public health risks”.Newsom acknowledged the Orange county beach plan in his briefing on Monday, which he called an “outstanding plan” that he “enthusiastically embraced”. “Those beaches will be reopened,” he said.“That’s the spirit of the moment, the spirit of the time,” Newsom said. “A sense of cooperation, recognizing the frustration that we all have and recognizing that we are all in this together and go a lot further together in that collaborative spirit.”<p><br clear="all">', 'description': '<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/california-eases-covid-19-restrictions-223422356.html"><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fSaAc0hYUWMbIC7mEqCcZw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/a6f99998ff24714cc2e959a0cb4cfd78" width="130" height="86" alt="California eases Covid-19 restrictions, allowing some businesses to reopen" align="left" title="California eases Covid-19 restrictions, allowing some businesses to reopen" border="0" ></a>Shops selling anything that a customer can purchase through curbside pickup will be able operate again, with modifications  * Coronavirus – latest US updates  * Coronavirus – latest global updates  * See all our coronavirus coverageSome California retailers will be allowed to reopen their businesses starting on Friday, the state’s governor said on Monday.More than six weeks after Gavin Newsom issued a statewide stay-at-home order, shops selling books, clothing, sporting goods, flowers or anything else that a customer can purchase through curbside pickup will be able to open again, if they implement certain modifications.“We are entering into the next phase this week,” Newsom said. “End of the week, with modifications, we will allow retail to start operating across the spectrum.”“This is a very positive sign and it has only happened for one reason: the data says it can happen,” he added.The easing in restrictions came after groups of protesters had gathered across the state in defiance of the lockdown last week.

Biden, who denied the allegation, had requested a search of the National Archives but told the secretary of the Senate, &quot;the Archives now states that the records would have remained under the control of the Senate.&quot; Biden requested the release of &quot;not only a complaint if one exists, but any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation.&quot;On Monday, however, the secretary of the Senate responded to Biden&#39;s request saying the office has &quot;no discretion to disclose&quot; the information, Axios reports. The statement cited &quot;strict confidentiality requirements.&quot;Reade says she filed a complaint against Biden with the Senate personnel office in the 1990s, although she says the complaint did not mention assault. Biden said in regard to the allegation last week, &quot;It is not true. I&#39;m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened. And it didn&#39;t. It never happened.&quot; The Biden campaign on Monday responded to the Senate secretary with several questions, including if there is anyone to whom the records could be disclosed legally.More stories from theweek.com  How George W.

And we’re going to have to continue to do things.”Asked how he would tell the American public about the need to reopen if he were the president, Christie responded: “The message is that the American people have gone through significant death before.”“We sent our young men during World War II over to Europe, out to the Pacific, knowing, knowing that many of them would not come home alive,” he said. “And we decided to make that sacrifice because what we were standing up for was the American way of life. In the very same way now, we have to stand up for the American way of life.”About half the states have begun to reopen public spaces and their economies in recent days despite cases growing in many areas and the confirmed U.S. death count from coronavirus approaching 70,000.

They Barely Mentioned Trump’s Rape Accuser." border="0" ></a>Fox News has unsurprisingly become the go-to cable-news outlet for chatter about the sexual-assault allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden. But when it came to similar (and more voluminous) allegations against his opponent, President Donald Trump, the network was seemingly nowhere to be found.\xa0Earlier this year, Tara Reade claimed that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee forced her against a wall and put his hands up her skirt when she worked as a staffer in his Senate office in the early 1990s. The narrative became instant red meat for Fox News, which has made the allegations one of its top stories across its cable and digital platforms, largely aggregating or riffing on reporting done by mainstream outlets while lamenting a supposed lack of media coverage of the story.\xa0According to a transcript search via media-monitoring service TVEyes, the Reade accusations have been mentioned at least 289 times on the network since late March, when Reade first detailed them in an interview with leftist podcast host Katie Halper.The same cannot be said of the conservative network’s coverage of the many sexual-misconduct allegations against Trump—most recently the ones made by journalist E. Jean Carroll.\xa0In June 2019, Carroll came forward with allegations that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in the ’90s. Like Reade’s claims, several of Carroll’s friends confirmed to various outlets that the writer had told them about the then-future president’s sexual assault at the time.Carroll’s story received major coverage across the news-media spectrum, but was virtually absent from Fox News in the months after she came forward.\xa0John Oliver: Biden Sexual-Assault Accuser Tara Reade ‘Deserves to Be Heard’According to a review of Fox News transcripts, in the two months following Carroll’s claims, the network dedicated only just over a half-dozen segments to the allegations. Her credible claims received mostly peripheral mentions in news reports, without the sort of panel discussions and debates that typify the network’s coverage of Reade’s allegations.\xa0In some of the brief moments that Carroll’s accusations were given airtime, the channel’s news anchors largely just read a line about the story and moved on. Elsewhere, Fox News merely framed its coverage around Trump’s denial of her claims.In an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), anchor Martha MacCallum brought up the accusation by noting Trump loyalist Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) had reacted to it, asking the Louisiana lawmaker how he thinks the accusations should be handled.“Just because you are accused of something doesn’t mean you’re guilty and doesn’t mean you’re not entitled to due process,” Kennedy declared. “I understand that the accuser is also coming up with a book. Some will say it’s true but some will wonder if she’s doing this to sell her book. I’m not saying she is or isn’t.”The only daily host who dedicated any serious time to the claims was Tucker Carlson, who spent an entire segment bashing the media coverage of her claims and eventually outright dismissing them, saying the allegations were “confusing” and that there was “no corroborating evidence.”“It&#39;s embarrassing and discredits all involved,” he told his guest.Fox’s resident media critic also decided the incident was worth a mention—but only from the perspective of whether the media’s coverage of MeToo allegations had been politicized by liberals.\xa0In an interview with former CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson, MediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz (who was once a Daily Beast columnist) framed the conversation around mainstream media outlets allegedly feeling “heat from the left” to devote more coverage to the famous writer’s claims against the president.Attkisson, for her part, said that being “overly cautious is not a bad thing when we&#39;re talking about these sorts of allegations” while Kurtz would go on to wonder if journalists were allowed to say “I have doubts about her story or she’s saying some odd things” in the MeToo era.Carroll wasn’t the only Trump sexual-assault accuser to receive minimal coverage from Fox News. Former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, for example, came forward in 2016—just days after the infamous Access Hollywood tapes, and amid a bevy of other accusers—with accusations that, a decade prior, the former reality-TV host-turned-president forced himself upon her, kissing and groping her while “thrusting his genitals” on her. Those claims, according to transcripts, were mentioned less than six times on Fox News, including one bizarre segment in which pro-Trump pundit David Wohl, father of right-wing mega-grifter Jacob Wohl, dismissed Zervos as “reading from a script.”And the paucity of mentions of Carroll (or the accusers that came before her) could hardly be more stark compared to Fox’s coverage of Reade, which has been one of the only major non-coronavirus stories the network has covered in recent weeks.\xa0The vast majority of the coverage, however, has occurred over the past week following progressive news outlet The Intercept’s April 24 report on Reade’s mother calling into CNN’s Larry King Live in 1993 and a Business Insider story from April 27 featuring two additional sources corroborating Reade’s claims.Much of Fox’s coverage of the allegations has largely centered on the perception of Democratic hypocrisy and a media double-standard compared to the way Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 2018.\xa0Why Have Women’s Groups Gone Dead Silent on Biden Sex-Assault Accusation?“If any of that had existed in the Kavanaugh case, Kavanaugh would&#39;ve been finished,” Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen said on April 28, in an example of a standard Fox panel segment on the allegations. “The Democratic standard here is that we believe the women as long as they are accusing a Republican,” he added. “I don’t know if Tara Reade is telling the truth or not but we should hold the Democrats to the same standards that they held themselves in the Kavanaugh case.”Tucker Carlson also blasted Democrats for their double standard on Biden vis a vis Kavanaugh, saying that “we’re not demanding that Democrats assume Joe Biden is guilty” but that it is “a little weird that they don’t take this seriously,” adding that it is now apparent “that their attempt to destroy Brett Kavanaugh wasn’t based on any genuine belief that he committed those crimes.”The presumption, if one were to watch Fox News coverage of the Reade story, would be that mainstream outlets more favorable to Democratic Party causes have ignored her claims about Biden while having dedicated much more airtime to Trump’s and Kavanaugh’s accusers.But while Fox’s rival outlets CNN and MSNBC may have been slow to cover the accusations, both have worked to advance the story in recent weeks, including critical coverage of Biden’s handling of the accusations on CNN and, on MSNBC, Morning Joe’s grilling of Biden on the matter—which Fox’s own media critic praised as “relentless.”And while Fox News hosts and commentators have breathlessly slammed the rest of the media for supposedly ignoring the story, the lion’s share of original reporting they have relied upon for their media-bashing segments has come from left-leaning or mainstream media outlets.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

They Barely Mentioned Trump’s Rape Accuser." align="left" title="Fox News Is Obsessed With Tara Reade. They Barely Mentioned Trump’s Rape Accuser." border="0" ></a>Fox News has unsurprisingly become the go-to cable-news outlet for chatter about the sexual-assault allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden. But when it came to similar (and more voluminous) allegations against his opponent, President Donald Trump, the network was seemingly nowhere to be found.\xa0Earlier this year, Tara Reade claimed that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee forced her against a wall and put his hands up her skirt when she worked as a staffer in his Senate office in the early 1990s. The narrative became instant red meat for Fox News, which has made the allegations one of its top stories across its cable and digital platforms, largely aggregating or riffing on reporting done by mainstream outlets while lamenting a supposed lack of media coverage of the story.\xa0According to a transcript search via media-monitoring service TVEyes, the Reade accusations have been mentioned at least 289 times on the network since late March, when Reade first detailed them in an interview with leftist podcast host Katie Halper.The same cannot be said of the conservative network’s coverage of the many sexual-misconduct allegations against Trump—most recently the ones made by journalist E. Jean Carroll.\xa0In June 2019, Carroll came forward with allegations that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in the ’90s. Like Reade’s claims, several of Carroll’s friends confirmed to various outlets that the writer had told them about the then-future president’s sexual assault at the time.Carroll’s story received major coverage across the news-media spectrum, but was virtually absent from Fox News in the months after she came forward.\xa0John Oliver: Biden Sexual-Assault Accuser Tara Reade ‘Deserves to Be Heard’According to a review of Fox News transcripts, in the two months following Carroll’s claims, the network dedicated only just over a half-dozen segments to the allegations. Her credible claims received mostly peripheral mentions in news reports, without the sort of panel discussions and debates that typify the network’s coverage of Reade’s allegations.\xa0In some of the brief moments that Carroll’s accusations were given airtime, the channel’s news anchors largely just read a line about the story and moved on. Elsewhere, Fox News merely framed its coverage around Trump’s denial of her claims.In an interview with Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), anchor Martha MacCallum brought up the accusation by noting Trump loyalist Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) had reacted to it, asking the Louisiana lawmaker how he thinks the accusations should be handled.“Just because you are accused of something doesn’t mean you’re guilty and doesn’t mean you’re not entitled to due process,” Kennedy declared. “I understand that the accuser is also coming up with a book.
